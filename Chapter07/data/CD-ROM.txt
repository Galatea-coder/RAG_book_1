Some CDs called enhanced CDs  hold both computer data and audio with the latter capable of being played on a CD player  while data such as software or digital video is only usable on a computer such as ISO 9660  2  format PC CDROMs. During the 1990s and early 2000s CDROMs were popularly used to distribute software and data for computers and fifth generation video game consoles . DVDs as well as downloading started to replace CDROMs in these roles starting in the early 2000s and the use of CDROMs for commercial software is now uncommon. History  edit  The earliest theoretical work on optical disc storage was done by independent researchers in the United States including David Paul Gregg 1958 and James Russel 19651975. In particular Greggs patents were used as the basis of the LaserDisc specification that was codeveloped between MCA and Philips after MCA purchased Greggs patents as well as the company he founded Gauss Electrophysics.  3  The LaserDisc was the immediate precursor to the CD with the primary difference being that the LaserDisc encoded information through an analog process whereas the CD used digital encoding. Key work to digitize the optical disc was performed by Toshi Doi and Kees Schouhamer Immink during 19791980 who worked on a taskforce for Sony and Philips .  4  The result was the Compact Disc Digital Audio CDDA defined in 1980. The CDROM was later designed as an extension of the CDDA and adapted this format to hold any form of digital data with an initial storage capacity of 553 MB .  5  Sony and Philips created the technical standard that defines the format of a CDROM in 1983  6  in what came to be called the Yellow Book . The CDROM was announced in 1984  7  and introduced by Denon and Sony at the first Japanese COMDEX computer show in 1985.  8  In November 1985 several computer industry participants including Microsoft  Philips  Sony  Apple and Digital Equipment Corporation  met to create a specification to define a file system format for CDROMs.  9  The resulting specification called the High Sierra format was published in May 1986.  9  It was eventually standardized with a few changes as the ISO 9660 standard in 1988. One of the first products to be made available to the public on CDROM was the Grolier Academic Encyclopedia  presented at the Microsoft CDROM Conference in March 1986.  9  CDROMs began being used in home video game consoles starting with the PC Engine CDROM 2 TurboGrafxCD in 1988 while CDROM drives had also become available for home computers by the end of the 1980s. In 1990 Data East demonstrated an arcade system board that supported CDROMs similar to 1980s LaserDisc video games but with digital data allowing more flexibility than older LaserDisc games.  10  By early 1990 about 300000 CDROM drives were sold in Japan while 125000 CDROM discs were being produced monthly in the United States.  11  Some computers that were marketed in the 1990s were called  multimedia  computers because they incorporated a CDROM drive which allowed for the delivery of several hundred megabytes of video picture and audio data. The first laptop to have an integrated CDROM drive as an option was 1993s CFV21P by Panasonic  however the drive only supported mini CDs up to 3.5 inches in diameter.  12   111 The first notebook to support standard 4.7inchdiameter discs was IBM s ThinkPad 755CD in 1994.  13  On early audio CD players that were released prior to the advent of the CDROM the raw binary data of CDROM was played back as noise. To address this problem the subcode channel Q has a data flag in areas of the disc that contain computer data rather than playable audio. The data flag instructs CD players to mute the audio.  14   15  CDROM discs  edit  Media  edit  A CDROM in the tray of a partially open CDROM drive. CDROMs are identical in appearance to audio CDs  and data are stored and retrieved in a very similar manner only differing from audio CDs in the standards used to store the data. Discs are made from a 1.2 mm thick disc of polycarbonate plastic  with a thin layer of aluminium to make a reflective surface. The most common size of CDROM is 120 mm in diameter though the smaller Mini CD standard with an 80 mm diameter as well as shaped compact discs in numerous nonstandard sizes and molds e.g. business cardsized media  also exist. Data is stored on the disc as a series of microscopic indentations called pits with the nonindented spaces between them called lands. A laser is shone onto the reflective surface of the disc to read the pattern of pits and lands. Because the depth of the pits is approximately onequarter to onesixth of the wavelength of the laser light used to read the disc the reflected beam s phase is shifted in relation to the incoming beam causing destructive interference and reducing the reflected beams intensity. This is converted into binary data. Standard  edit  Several formats are used for data stored on compact discs known as the Rainbow Books . The Yellow Book  created in 1983  6   16  defines the specifications for CDROMs standardized in 1988 as the ISO  IEC 10149  1  standard and in 1989 as the ECMA 130  17  standard. The CDROM standard builds on top of the original Red Book CDDA standard for CD audio. Other standards such as the White Book for Video CDs  further define formats based on the CDROM specifications. The Yellow Book itself is not freely available but the standards with the corresponding content can be downloaded for free from ISO or ECMA. There are several standards that define how to structure data files on a CDROM. ISO 9660 defines the standard file system for a CDROM. ISO 13490 is an improvement on this standard which adds support for nonsequential writeonce and rewriteable discs such as CDR and CDRW  as well as multiple sessions . The ISO 13346 standard was designed to address most of the shortcomings of ISO 9660  18  and a subset of it evolved into the UDF format which was  adopted for DVDs . A bootable CD specification called El Torito  was issued in January 1995 to make a CD emulate a hard disk or floppy disk . Manufacture  edit  Main article Compact Disc manufacturing Prepressed CDROMs are massproduced by a process of stamping where a glass master disc is created and used to make stampers which are in turn used to manufacture multiple copies of the final disc with the pits already present. Recordable  CDR  and rewritable  CDRW  discs are manufactured by a different method whereby the data are recorded on them by a laser changing the properties of a dye or phase transition material in a process that is often referred to as  burning . CDROM format  edit  Data stored on CDROMs follows the standard CD data encoding techniques described in the Red Book specification originally defined for audio CD only. This includes crossinterleaved ReedSolomon coding CIRC  19  eighttofourteen modulation EFM and the use of pits and lands for coding the bits into the physical surface of the CD. The structures used to group data on a CDROM are also derived from the Red Book . Like audio CDs CDDA a CDROM sector contains 2352 bytes of user data composed of 98 frames each consisting of 33 bytes 24 bytes for the user data 8 bytes for error correction and 1 byte for the sub code. Unlike audio CDs the data stored in these sectors corresponds to any type of digital data not audio samples encoded according to the audio CD specification. To structure address and protect this data the CDROM standard further defines two sector modes Mode 1 and Mode 2 which describe two different layouts for the data inside a sector.  2  A track a group of sectors inside a CDROM only contains sectors in the same mode but if multiple tracks are present in a CDROM each track can have its sectors in a different mode from the rest of the tracks. They can also coexist with audio CD tracks which is the case of mixed mode CDs . Sector structure  edit  Both Mode 1 and 2 sectors use the first 16 bytes for header information but differ in the remaining 2336 bytes due to the use of error correction bytes. Unlike an audio CD a CDROM cannot rely on error concealment by interpolation  a higher reliability of the retrieved data is required. To achieve improved error correction and detection Mode 1 used mostly for digital data adds a 32bit cyclic redundancy check CRC code for error detection and a third layer of ReedSolomon error correction  n 1  using a ReedSolomon Productlike Code RSPC. Mode 1 therefore contains 288 bytes per sector for error detection and correction leaving 2048 bytes per sector available for data. Mode 2 which is more appropriate for image or video data where perfect reliability may be a little bit less important contains no additional error detection or correction bytes having therefore 2336 available data bytes per sector. Both modes like audio CDs still benefit from the lower layers of error correction at the frame level.  20  Before being stored on a disc with the techniques described above each CDROM sector is scrambled to prevent some problematic patterns from showing up.  17  These scrambled sectors then follow the same encoding process described in the Red Book in order to be finally stored on a CD. The following table shows a comparison of the structure of sectors in CDDA and CDROMs  17  Format  2352 byte sector structure  CD digital audio 2352 Digital audio CDROM Mode 1 12 Sync pattern 3 Address 1 Mode 0x01 2048 Data 4 Error detection 8 Reserved zero 276 Error correction CDROM Mode 2 12 Sync pattern 3 Address 1 Mode 0x02 2336 Data The net byte rate of a Mode1 CDROM based on comparison to CDDA audio standards is 44100 Hz  16 bitssample  2 channels  2048  2352  8  150 KBs 150  2 10  . This value 150 Kbytes is defined as 1 speed. Therefore for Mode 1 CDROMs a 1 CDROM drive reads 1502  75 consecutive sectors per second. The playing time of a standard CD is 74 minutes or 4440 seconds contained in 333000 blocks or sectors . Therefore the net capacity of a Mode1 CDROM is 650 MB 650  2 20 . For 80 minute CDs the capacity is 703 MB. CDROM XA extension  edit  CDROM XA is an extension of the Yellow Book standard for CDROMs that combines compressed audio video and computer data allowing all to be accessed simultaneously.  21  It was intended as a bridge between CDROM and CDi  Green Book  and was published by Sony and Philips  and backed by Microsoft  in 1991  22  first announced in September 1988.  23  XA stands for eXtended Architecture. CDROM XA defines two new sector layouts called Mode 2 Form 1 and Mode 2 Form 2 which are different from the original Mode 2. XA Mode 2 Form 1 is similar to the Mode 1 structure described above and can interleave with XA Mode 2 Form 2 sectors it is used for data. XA Mode 2 Form 2 has 2324 bytes of user data and is similar to the standard Mode 2 but with error detection bytes added though no error correction. It can interleave with XA Mode 2 Form 1 sectors and it is used for audiovideo data.  20  Video CDs  Super Video CDs  Photo CDs  Enhanced Music CDs and CDi use these sector modes.  24  The following table shows a comparison of the structure of sectors in CDROM XA modes Format  2352 byte sector structure  CDROM XA Mode 2 Form 1 12 Sync pattern 3 Address 1 Mode 8 Subheader 2048 Data 4 Error detection 276 Error correction CDROM XA Mode 2 Form 2 12 Sync pattern 3 Address 1 Mode 8 Subheader 2324 Data 4 Error detection Disc images  edit  When a disc image of a CDROM is created this can be done in either raw mode extracting 2352 bytes per sector independent of the internal structure or obtaining only the sectors useful data 2048233623522324 bytes depending on the CDROM mode. The file size of a disc image created in raw mode is always a multiple of 2352 bytes the size of a block.  25  Disc image formats that store raw CDROM sectors include CCDIMG  CUEBIN  and MDSMDF . The size of a disc image created from the data in the sectors will depend on the type of sectors it is using. For example if a CDROM mode 1 image is created by extracting only each sectors data its size will be a multiple of 2048 this is usually the case for ISO disc images . On a 74minute CDR it is possible to fit larger disc images using raw mode up to 333000  2352  783216000 bytes 747 MB. This is the upper limit for raw images created on a 74 min or 650 MB Red Book CD. The 14.8 increase is due to the discarding of error correction data. Capacity  edit  A CDROM can easily store the entirety of a paper encyclopedias words and images plus audio  video clips. CDROM capacities are normally expressed with binary prefixes  subtracting the space used for error correction data.  26  The capacity of a CDROM depends on how close the outward data track is extended to the discs outer rim.  27  A standard 120 mm 700 MB CDROM can actually hold about 703 MB of data with error correction or 847 MB total. In comparison a singlelayer DVDROM can hold 4.7 GB 4.7  10 9 bytes of errorprotected data more than 6 CDROMs. Capacities of Compact Disc types 90 and 99 minute discs are not standard Type Sectors Data mode 1 max. size Audio max. size Time  MiB  Approx. 1  2 20  MiB  min  8 cm 94500 193.536 184.570 222.264 21 553 MB 283500 580.608 553.711 666.792 63 650 MB 333000 681.984 650.391 783.216 74 700 MB 360000 737.280 703.125 846.720 80 800 MB 405000 829.440 791.016 952.560 90 900 MB 445500 912.384 870.117 1047.816 99 Note mebibyte MiB and minute min values are exact 1  2 20  values are approximate. CDROM drives  edit  This section needs expansion with Information on access time latency. You can help by adding to it .  June 2014  Further information Optical disc drive A view of a CDROM drives disassembled laser system The movement of the laser enables reading at any position of the CD. The laser system of a CDROM drive CDROM discs are read using CDROM drives. A CDROM drive may be connected to the computer via an IDE  ATA  SCSI  SATA  FireWire  or USB interface or a proprietary interface such as the Panasonic CD interface  LMSIPhilips Sony and Mitsumi standards. Virtually all modern CDROM drives can also play audio CDs as well as Video CDs and other data standards when used with the right software. Laser and optics  edit  CDROM drives employ a near infrared 780 nm laser diode . The laser beam is directed onto the disc via an optoelectronic tracking module which then detects whether the beam has been reflected or scattered. Transfer rates  edit  Original speed  edit  CDROM drives are rated with a speed factor relative to music CDs. If a CDROM is read at the same rotational speed as an audio CD  the data transfer rate is 150 Kbytes commonly called 1 with constant linear velocity short CLV . At this data rate the track moves along under the laser spot at about 1.2 ms. To maintain this linear velocity as the optical head moves to different positions the angular velocity is varied from about 500 rpm at the inner edge to 200 rpm at the outer edge. The 1 speed rating for CDROM 150 Kbytes is different from the 1 speed rating for DVDs 1.32 MBs. Speed advancements  edit  When the speed at which the disc is spun is increased data can be transferred at greater rates. For example a CDROM drive that can read at 8 speed spins the disc at 1600 to 4000 rpm giving a linear velocity of 9.6 ms and a transfer rate of 1200 Kbytes. Above 12 speed most drives read at Constant angular velocity CAV constant rpm so that the motor is not made to change from one speed to another as the head seeks from place to place on the disc. In CAV mode the  number denotes the transfer rate at the outer edge of the disc where it is a maximum.
20 was thought to be the maximum speed due to mechanical constraints until Samsung Electronics introduced the SCR3230 a 32 CDROM drive which uses a ball bearing system to balance the spinning disc in the drive to reduce vibration and noise. As of 2004 the fastest transfer rate commonly available is about 52 or 10400 rpm and 7.62 MBs. Higher spin speeds are limited by the strength of the polycarbonate plastic of which the discs are made. At 52 the linear velocity of the outermost part of the disc is around 65 ms. However improvements can still be obtained using multiple laser pickups as demonstrated by the Kenwood TrueX 72 which uses seven laser beams and a rotation speed of approximately 10. The first 12 drive was released in late 1996.  28  Above 12 speed there are problems with vibration and heat. CAV drives give speeds up to 30 at the outer edge of the disc with the same rotational speed as a standard  constant linear velocity  CLV 12 or 32 with a slight increase. However due to the nature of CAV linear speed at the inner edge is still only 12 increasing smoothly inbetween the actual throughput increase is less than 3012 in fact roughly 20 average for a completely full disc and even less for a partially filled one. Physical limitations  edit  Problems with vibration owing to limits on achievable symmetry and strength in massproduced media mean that CDROM drive speeds have not massively increased since the late 1990s. Over 10 years later commonly available drives vary between 24 slimline and portable units 10 spin speed and 52 typically CD and readonly units 21 spin speed all using CAV to achieve their claimed max speeds with 32 through 48 most common. Even so these speeds can cause poor reading drive error correction having become very sophisticated in response and even shattering of poorly made or physically damaged media with small cracks rapidly growing into catastrophic breakages when centripetally stressed at 1000013000 rpm i.e. 4052 CAV. High rotational speeds also produce undesirable noise from disc vibration rushing air and the spindle motor itself. Most 21stcentury drives allow forced low speed modes by use of small utility programs for the sake of safety accurate reading or silence and will automatically fall back if numerous sequential read errors and retries are encountered. Workarounds  edit  Other methods of improving read speed were trialled such as using multiple optical beams increasing throughput up to 72 with a 10 spin speed but along with other technologies like 9099 minute recordable media GigaRec and doubledensity compact disc  Purple Book standard recorders their utility was nullified by the introduction of consumer DVDROM drives capable of consistent 36 equivalent CDROM speeds 4 DVD or higher. Additionally with a 700 MB CDROM fully readable in under 2.5 minutes at 52 CAV increases in actual data transfer rate are decreasingly influential on overall effective drive speed when taken into consideration with other factors such as loadingunloading media recognition spin updown and random seek times making for much decreased returns on development investment. A similar stratification effect has since been seen in DVD development where maximum speed has stabilised at 16 CAV with exceptional cases between 18 and 22 and capacity at 4.3 and 8.5 GB single and dual layer with higher speed and capacity needs instead being catered to by Bluray drives. Speed ratings  edit  CDRecordable drives are often sold with three different speed ratings one speed for writeonce operations one for rewrite operations and one for readonly operations. The speeds are typically listed in that order i.e. a 121032 CD drive can write to CDR discs at 12 speed 1.76 MBs write to CDRW discs at 10 speed 1.46 MBs and read from CDs at 32 speed 4.69 MBs if the CPU and media player software permit speeds that high.

The CDROM itself may contain weak sectors to make copying the disc more difficult and additional data that may be difficult or impossible to copy to a CDR or disc image but which the software checks for each time it is run to ensure an original disc and not an unauthorized copy is present in the computers CDROM drive.  citation needed  Manufacturers of CD writers  CDR or CDRW  are encouraged by the music industry to ensure that every drive they produce has a unique identifier which will be encoded by the drive on every disc that it records the RID or Recorder Identification Code.  34  This is a counterpart to the Source Identification Code SID an eight character code beginning with  IFPI  that is usually stamped on discs produced by CD recording plants.
