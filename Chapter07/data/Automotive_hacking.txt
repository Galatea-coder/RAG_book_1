Computer security term for hacking of automobiles  1  Automotive hacking is the exploitation of vulnerabilities within the software hardware and communication systems of automobiles . Overview  edit  Modern automobiles contain hundreds of onboard computers processing everything from vehicle controls to the infotainment system.  These computers called Electronic control units ECU communicate with each other through multiple networks and communication protocols including the Controller Area Network CAN for vehicle component communication such as connections between engine and brake control Local Interconnect Network LIN for cheaper vehicle component communication such as between door locks and interior lights Media Oriented Systems Transport MOST for infotainment systems such as modern touchscreen and telematics connections and FlexRay for highspeed vehicle component communications such as active suspension and active cruise control data synchronization.  2  Additional consumer communication systems are also integrated into automobile architectures including Bluetooth for wireless device connections 4G Internet hotspots and vehicle WiFi .  3  The integration of these various communications and software systems leaves automobiles vulnerable to attack. Security researchers have begun demonstrating the multitude of potential attack vectors in modern vehicles and some realworld exploits have resulted in manufacturers issuing vehicle recalls and software updates to mobile applications. Manufacturers such as John Deere  have used computer systems and Digital Rights Management to prevent repairs by the vehicle owners or by third parties or the use of aftermarket parts.  4  Such limitations have prompted efforts to circumvent these systems and increased interest in measures such as Motor Vehicle Owners Right to Repair Act . Research  edit  In 2010 security researchers demonstrated how they could create physical effects and undermine system controls by hacking the ECU.  The researchers needed physical access to the ECU and were able to gain full control over any safety or automotive system including disabling the brakes and stopping the engine.  5  In a followup research paper published in 2011 researchers demonstrated that physical access is not even necessary.  The researchers showed that remote exploitation is feasible via...mechanics tools CD players Bluetooth cellular radio...and wireless communication channels allow long distance vehicle control location tracking incabin audio exfiltration and theft.  6  This means that a hacker could gain access to a vehicles vital control systems through almost anything that interfaces with the automobiles systems. Recent exploits  edit  2015 Fiat Chrysler UConnect Hack  edit  UConnect is Fiat Chrysler s Internetconnected feature which enables owners the ability to control the vehicles infotainmentnavigation system sync media and make phone calls.  It even integrates with the optional onboard WiFi.  7  However vulnerabilities in Fiat Chryslers UConnect system available on over 1.4 million cars allows hackers to scan for cars with the system connect and embed malicious code  and ultimately commandeer vital vehicle controls like steering and brakes.  8  2015 Tesla Model S Hack  edit  In 2015 at the DEF CON hacking conference Marc Rogers and Kevin Mahaffey demonstrated  9   10  how a chain of exploits could be used to take complete control of the Model S. Marc Rogers and Kevin Mahaffey identified several remote and local vulnerabilities that could be used as entry points. They demonstrated that after exploitation the vehicle could be remotely controlled with an iPhone.  11  Finally they also demonstrated that it was possible to install a backdoor that allowed persistent access and control of the vehicle in a similar fashion to exploit techniques more usually associated with traditional computer systems. Marc Rogers and Kevin Mahaffey worked with Tesla Inc. to resolve the issues before disclosure. It was announced before the presentation that the entire global fleet of Model S cars had been patched overnight the first proactive mass Over The Air OTA security update of vulnerable vehicles.  12   13  General Motors OnStar RemoteLink App  edit  The OnStar RemoteLink app allows users the ability to utilize OnStar capabilities from their Android or iOS smartphones.  The RemoteLink app can locate lock and unlock and even start your vehicle.  14  The flaw in General Motors  OnStar RemoteLink app while not as extreme as UConnect allows hackers to impersonate the victim in the eyes of the RemoteLink app.  This means that the hackers can access all of the features of the RemoteLink app available to the victim including locating locking and unlocking and starting the engine.  15  Keyless entry  edit  The security researcher Samy Kamkar has demonstrated a device that intercepts signals from keylessentry fobs and would allow an attacker to unlock doors and start a cars engine.  16  USB entry  edit  Kia back windows can be broken without setting off an alarm and Hyundai are similar.  17  Since 2021  18   19   20  on social media  21   22   23  videos show stealing of post2010 Kia vehicles and post2014 Hyundai vehicles without engine immobilizers  with a USB 1.1 A plug cable  or pliers.  24   25   26   27   28   29   30   31  Kia started installing immobilizers in 2022.  20   32  2022 CAN injection keyless car theft  edit  Using a fake device sold on the dark web thieves were able to steal vehicles by forcing the headlamps open and accessing the CAN bus and then once on the bus to simulate the signals to start the vehicle.  The exploit requires enough time and privacy for thieves to remove vehicle hardware sometimes bumpers in order to open the headlights.  33  Possibly the only way to prevent this kind of event by determined and knowledgeable thieves would be for car designers to encrypt traffic on the CAN bus.
