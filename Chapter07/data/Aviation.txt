Aircraft includes fixedwing and rotarywing types morphable wings wingless lifting bodies as well as lighterthanair aircraft such as hot air balloons and airships . Aviation began in the 18th century with the development of the hot air balloon  an apparatus capable of atmospheric displacement through buoyancy . Clément Ader built the Ader Éole in France and made an uncontrolled powered hop in 1890. This is the first powered aircraft although it did not achieve controlled flight. Some of the most significant advancements in aviation technology came with the controlled gliding flying of Otto Lilienthal in 1896 then a large step in significance came with the construction of the first powered airplane by the Wright brothers in the early 1900s. Since that time aviation has been technologically revolutionized by the introduction of the jet which permitted a major form of transport throughout the world. Etymology  edit  The word aviation was coined by the French writer and former naval officer Gabriel La Landelle in 1863.  1  He originally derived the term from the verb avier an unsuccessful neologism for to fly itself derived from the Latin word avis bird and the suffix ation .  2  History  edit  Main article History of aviation For a chronological guide see Timeline of aviation . Early beginnings  edit  There are early legends of human flight such as the stories of Icarus in Greek myth Jamshid and Shah Kay Kāvus in Persian myth  3  and the flying automaton of Archytas of Tarentum 428347 BC.  4  Later somewhat more credible claims of shortdistance human flights appear such as the winged flights of Abbas ibn Firnas 810887 recorded in the 17th century Eilmer of Malmesbury 11th century recorded in the 12th century and the hotair Passarola of Bartholomeu Lourenço de Gusmão 16851724. Lighter than air  edit  LZ 129 Hindenburg at Lakehurst Naval Air Station  1936 The modern age of aviation began with the first untethered human lighterthanair flight on November 21 1783 of a hot air balloon designed by the Montgolfier brothers .  5  The usefulness of balloons was limited because they could only travel downwind. It was immediately recognized that a steerable or dirigible  balloon was required. JeanPierre Blanchard flew the first humanpowered dirigible in 1784 and crossed the English Channel in one in 1785. Rigid airships became the first aircraft to transport passengers and cargo over great distances. The best known aircraft of this type were manufactured by the German Zeppelin company. The most successful Zeppelin was the Graf Zeppelin . It flew over one million miles including an aroundtheworld flight in August 1929. However the dominance of the Zeppelins over the airplanes of that period which had a range of only a few hundred miles was diminishing as airplane design advanced. The Golden Age of the airships ended on May 6 1937. That year the Hindenburg caught fire killing 36 people. The cause of the Hindenburg accident was initially blamed on the use of hydrogen instead of helium as the lift gas. An internal investigation by the manufacturer revealed that the coating used in the material covering the frame was highly flammable and allowed static electricity to build up in the airship.  6  Changes to the coating formulation reduced the risk of further Hindenburg type accidents. Although there have been periodic initiatives to revive their use airships have seen only niche application since that time.  7  There had been previous airship accidents that were more fatal for instance a British R38 on 23 August 1921  8  but the Hindenburg was the first to be captured on newsreel.  9  Heavier than air  edit  In 1799 Sir George Cayley set forth the concept of the modern airplane as a fixedwing flying machine with separate systems for lift propulsion and control.  10   11  Lilienthal in midflight Berlin c. 1895 Otto Lilienthal was the first person to make welldocumented repeated successful flights with gliders   12  therefore making the idea of  heavier than air  a reality. Newspapers and magazines published photographs of Lilienthal gliding favorably influencing public and scientific opinion about the possibility of flying machines becoming practical.
Lilienthals work led to him developing the concept of the modern wing.  13   14  His flight attempts in Berlin in 1891 are seen as the beginning of human flight  15  and the  Lilienthal Normalsegelapparat  is considered to be the first airplane in series production making the Maschinenfabrik Otto Lilienthal in Berlin the first air plane production company in the world.  16  Lilienthal is often referred to as either the father of aviation  17   18   19  or father of flight.  20  Early dirigible developments included machinepowered propulsion  Henri Giffard  1852 rigid frames  David Schwarz  1896 and improved speed and maneuverability  Alberto SantosDumont  1901 First powered and controlled flight by the Wright brothers  December 17 1903 There are many competing claims for the earliest powered heavierthanair flight. The first recorded powered flight was carried out by Clément Ader on October 9 1890 in his batwinged fully selfpropelled fixedwing aircraft  the Ader Éole . It was reportedly the first manned powered heavierthanair flight of a significant distance 50 m 160 ft but insignificant altitude from level ground.  21   22   23  Seven years later on October 14 1897 Aders Avion III was tested without success in front of two officials from the French War ministry. The report on the trials was not publicized until 1910 as they had been a military secret. In November 1906 Ader claimed to have made a successful flight on October 14 1897 achieving an uninterrupted flight of around 300 metres 980 feet. Although widely believed at the time these claims were later discredited.  24   25  The Wright brothers made the first successful powered controlled and sustained airplane flight on December 17 1903 a feat made possible by their invention of threeaxis control  26  and inhouse development of an engine with a sufficient powertoweight ratio .  27  Only a decade later at the start of World War I  heavierthanair powered aircraft had become practical for reconnaissance artillery spotting and even attacks against ground positions. Aircraft began to transport people and cargo as designs grew larger and more reliable. The Wright brothers took aloft the first passenger Charles Furnas one of their mechanics on May 14 1908.  28   29  During the 1920s and 1930s great progress was made in the field of aviation including the first transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown in 1919 Charles Lindbergh s solo transatlantic flight in 1927 and Charles Kingsford Smith s transpacific flight the following year. One of the most successful designs of this period was the Douglas DC3  which became the first airliner to be profitable carrying passengers exclusively starting the modern era of passenger airline service. By the beginning of World War II many towns and cities had built airports and there were numerous qualified pilots available. During World War II one of the first jet engines was developed by Hans con Ohain and accomplished the worlds first jetpowered flight in 1939.  30  The war brought many innovations to aviation including the first jet aircraft and the first liquidfueled rockets . The Cessna 172 is the most produced aircraft in history  31  After World War II especially in North America there was a boom in general aviation  both private and commercial as thousands of pilots were released from military service and many inexpensive warsurplus transport and training aircraft became available. Manufacturers such as Cessna  Piper  and Beechcraft expanded production to provide light aircraft for the new middleclass market. By the 1950s the development of civil jets grew beginning with the de Havilland Comet  though the first widely used passenger jet was the Boeing 707  because it was much more economical than other aircraft at that time. At the same time turboprop propulsion started to appear for smaller commuter planes making it possible to serve smallvolume routes in a much wider range of weather conditions. Since the 1960s composite material airframes and quieter more efficient engines have become available and Concorde provided supersonic passenger service for more than two decades but the most important lasting innovations have taken place in instrumentation and control. The arrival of solidstate electronics the Global Positioning System  satellite communications  and increasingly small and powerful computers and LED displays have dramatically changed the cockpits of airliners and increasingly of smaller aircraft as well. Pilots can navigate much more accurately and view terrain obstructions and other nearby aircraft on a map or through synthetic vision  even at night or in low visibility. NASA s Helios researches solar powered flight. On June 21 2004 SpaceShipOne became the first privately funded aircraft to make a spaceflight  opening the possibility of an aviation market capable of leaving the Earths atmosphere. Meanwhile the need to decarbonize the aviation industry to face the climate crisis has increased research into aircraft powered by alternative fuels such as ethanol  electricity  hydrogen  and even solar energy  with flying prototypes becoming more common. Operations of aircraft  edit  Civil aviation  edit  Main article Civil aviation Further information Commercial aviation and Private aviation Civil aviation includes all nonmilitary flying both general aviation and scheduled air transport . Air transport  edit  Main article Airline A United Airlines Boeing 777200 taxiing on the tarmac of Heathrow Airport in January 2011. The Boeing 777 is a popular choice for airlines that operate a widebody aircraft . Delta Airlines Airbus A330323 taking off at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in July 2017. There are five major manufacturers of civil transport aircraft in alphabetical order Airbus  based in Europe Boeing  based in the United States Bombardier  based in Canada Embraer  based in Brazil United Aircraft Corporation  based in Russia with its subsidiaries Ilyushin  Tupolev  and Sukhoi Boeing Airbus Ilyushin and Tupolev concentrate on widebody and narrowbody jet airliners  while Bombardier Embraer and Sukhoi concentrate on regional airliners . Large networks of specialized parts suppliers from around the world support these manufacturers who sometimes provide only the initial design and final assembly in their own plants. The Chinese ACAC consortium has also recently entered the civil transport market with its Comac ARJ21 regional jet.  32   33  Until the 1970s most major airlines were flag carriers  sponsored by their governments and heavily protected from competition. Since then open skies agreements have resulted in increased competition and choice for consumers coupled with falling prices for airlines. The combination of high fuel prices low fares high salaries and crises such as the September 11 attacks and the SARS pandemic have driven many older airlines to governmentbailouts bankruptcy or mergers. At the same time lowcost carriers such as Ryanair  Southwest and WestJet have flourished. General aviation  edit  Main article General aviation 1940 Piper Cub General aviation includes all nonscheduled civil flying both private and commercial . General aviation may include business flights air charter  private aviation flight training ballooning  paragliding  parachuting  gliding  hang gliding  aerial photography  footlaunched powered hang gliders  air ambulance crop dusting charter flights traffic reporting  police air patrols and forest fire fighting. Each country regulates aviation differently but general aviation usually falls under different regulations depending on whether it is private or commercial and on the type of equipment involved. Many small aircraft manufacturers serve the general aviation market with a focus on private aviation and flight training. The most important recent developments for small aircraft which form the bulk of the GA fleet have been the introduction of advanced avionics including GPS  that were formerly found only in large airliners  and the introduction of composite materials to make small aircraft lighter and faster. Ultralight and homebuilt aircraft have also become increasingly popular for recreational use since in most countries that allow private aviation they are much less expensive and less heavily regulated than certified aircraft. Military aviation  edit  Main articles Military aviation and Aerial warfare Simple balloons were used as surveillance aircraft as early as the 18th century. Over the years military aircraft have been built to meet ever increasing capability requirements. Manufacturers of military aircraft compete for contracts to supply their governments arsenal. Aircraft are selected based on factors like cost performance and the speed of production. The Lockheed SR71 remains unsurpassed in many areas of performance.  34  Types of military aviation  edit  Fighter aircraft s primary function is to destroy other aircraft. e.g. F35  Eurofighter Typhoon  F15  MiG29  Su27  and F22 . Ground attack aircraft are used against tactical earthbound targets. e.g. Panavia Tornado  A10  Il2  J22 Orao  AH64 and Su25 . Bombers are generally used against more strategic targets such as factories and oil fields. e.g. B2  Tu95  Mirage IV  and B52 . Transport aircraft are used to transport hardware and personnel. e.g. C17 Globemaster III  C130 Hercules and Mil Mi26 . Surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft obtain information about enemy forces. e.g. RC135  E8  U2  OH58 and MiG25R . Unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs are used primarily as reconnaissance fixedwing aircraft though many also carry payloads e.g. MQ9  RQ4  and MQ1C Gray Eagle . Cargo aircraft are in development. Missiles deliver warheads normally explosives. Air safety  edit  Main article Aviation safety Aviation safety means the state of an aviation system or organization in which risks associated with aviation activities related to or in direct support of the operation of aircraft are reduced and controlled to an acceptable level. It encompasses the theory practice investigation and categorization of flight failures and the prevention of such failures through regulation education and training. It can also be applied in the context of campaigns that inform the public as to the safety of air travel. Aviation MRO  edit  A maintenance repair and overhaul organization MRO is a firm that ensures airworthiness or air transport. According to a 2024 article maintenance M involves inspecting cleaning oiling and changing aircraft parts after a certain number of flight hours. Repair R is restoring the original function of parts and components. Overhaul O refers to extensive maintenance the complete refurbishment of the aircraft and upgrades in avionics which can take several weeks to complete.  35  Airlines are legally obligated to certify airworthiness meaning that a civil aviation authority must approve an aircraft suitable for safe flight operations.  36  MRO firms are responsible for this process thoroughly checking and documenting all components repairs while tracking mechanical propulsion and electronic parts.  37  Aviation regulators oversee maintenance practices in the country of aircraft registration manufacture or current location. All aircraft maintenance activities must adhere to international regulations that mandate standards.  38   35  Aviation accidents and incidents  edit  Main article Aviation accidents and incidents A USAF Thunderbird pilot ejecting from his F16 aircraft at an air show in 2003 An aviation accident is defined by the Convention on International Civil Aviation Annex 13 as an occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the aircraft with the intention of flight until such time as all such persons have disembarked in which a person is fatally or seriously injured the aircraft sustains damage or structural failure or the aircraft is missing or is completely inaccessible.  39  An accident in which the damage to the aircraft is such that it must be written off or in which the plane is destroyed is called a hull loss accident .  40  The first fatal aviation accident occurred in a Wright Model A aircraft at Fort Myer Virginia US  on September 17 1908 resulting in injury to the pilot Orville Wright  and death of the passenger Signal Corps Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge . The worst aviation accident in history was the Tenerife airport disaster on March 27 1977 when 583 people died when two Boeing 747 jumbo jets operated by Pan Am and KLM collided on a runway in Los Rodeos airport now known as Tenerife North. An aviation incident is defined as an occurrence other than an accident associated with the operation of an aircraft that affects or could affect the safety of operations.  40  Air traffic control  edit  Main article Air traffic control Air traffic control towers at Amsterdam Airport Air traffic control ATC involves communication with aircraft to help maintain separation  that is they ensure that aircraft are sufficiently far enough apart horizontally or vertically for no risk of collision. Controllers may coordinate position reports provided by pilots or in high traffic areas such as the United States they may use radar to see aircraft positions. Becoming an air traffic controller in the United States typically requires an associate or bachelors degree from the Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative. The FAA also requires extensive training along with medical examinations and background checks.  Some controllers are required to work weekend night and holiday shifts.  41  There are generally four different types of ATC Center controllers who control aircraft en route between airports Control towers including tower ground control clearance delivery and other services which control aircraft within a small distance typically 1015 km horizontal and 1000 m vertical of an airport. Oceanic controllers who control aircraft over international waters between continents generally without radar service. Terminal controllers who control aircraft in a wider area typically 5080 km around busy airports ATC is especially important for aircraft flying under instrument flight rules IFR when they may be in weather conditions that do not allow the pilots to see other aircraft. However in very hightraffic areas especially near major airports aircraft flying under visual flight rules VFR are also required to follow instructions from ATC. In addition to separation from other aircraft ATC may provide weather advisories terrain separation navigation assistance and other services to pilots depending on their workload. ATC do not control all flights. The majority of VFR Visual Flight Rules flights in North America are not required to contact ATC unless they are passing through a busy terminal area or using a major airport and in many areas such as northern Canada and low altitude in northern Scotland air traffic control services are not available even for IFR flights at lower altitudes. Environmental impact  edit  Main article Environmental impact of aviation Like all activities involving combustion  operating powered aircraft from airliners to hot air balloons releases soot and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide CO 2  are also produced. In addition there are environmental impacts specific to aviation for instance Water vapor contrails left by highaltitude jet airliners . These may contribute to cirrus cloud formation. Aircraft operating at high altitudes near the tropopause mainly large jet airliners  emit aerosols and leave contrails  both of which can increase cirrus cloud formation  cloud cover may have increased by up to 0.2 since the birth of aviation.  42  Clouds can have both a cooling and warming effect. They reflect some of the suns rays back into space but also block some of the heat radiated by Earths surface. On average both thin natural cirrus clouds and contrails have a net warming effect.  43  Aircraft operating at high altitudes near the tropopause can also release chemicals that interact with greenhouse gases at those altitudes particularly nitrogen compounds  which interact with ozone increasing ozone concentrations.  44   45  Most light piston aircraft burn avgas  which contains tetraethyllead TEL. Some lowercompression piston engines can operate on unleaded mogas  and turbine engines and diesel engines  neither of which require lead  are appearing on some newer light aircraft . Another environmental impact of aviation is noise pollution  mainly caused by aircraft taking off and landing. Sonic booms were a problem with supersonic aircraft such as the Concorde .
