CERT Coordination Center Company type FFRDC part of Software Engineering Institute  Industry Software and Network Security Founded 1988 Headquarters Pittsburgh PA  United States Key people US AF Brigadier General ret Gregory J. Touhill Director Website sei .cmu .edu about divisions cert index .cfm The CERT Coordination Center  CERTCC  is the coordination center of the computer emergency response team CERT for the Software Engineering Institute SEI a nonprofit United States federally funded research and development center . The CERTCC researches software bugs that impact software and internet security publishes research and information on its findings and works with businesses and the government to improve the security of software and the internet as a whole. History  edit  The first organization of its kind the CERTCC was created in Pittsburgh in November 1988 at DARPA s direction in response to the Morris worm incident.  1  The CERTCC is now part of the CERT Division of the Software Engineering Institute which has more than 150 cybersecurity professionals working on projects that take a proactive approach to securing systems. The CERT Program partners with government industry law enforcement and academia to develop advanced methods and technologies to counter largescale sophisticated cyber threats. The CERT Program is part of the Software Engineering Institute SEI a federally funded research and development center  FFRDC  at Carnegie Mellon Universitys main campus in Pittsburgh. CERT is a registered trademark of Carnegie Mellon University.  2  Confusion with USCERT and other CERTs  edit  In 2003 the Department of Homeland Security entered into an agreement with Carnegie Mellon University to create USCERT .  3  USCERT is the national computer security incident response team  CSIRT  for the United States of America. This cooperation often causes confusion between the CERTCC and USCERT. While related the two organizations are distinct entities. In general USCERT handles cases that concern US national security whereas CERTCC handles more general cases often internationally. The CERTCC coordinates information with USCERT and other computer security incident response teams some of which are licensed to use the name CERT.  4  While these organizations license the CERT name from Carnegie Mellon University these organizations are independent entities established in their own countries and are not operated by the CERTCC. The CERTCC established FIRST  an organization promoting cooperation and information exchange between the various National CERTs and private product security incident response teams PSIRTs. Capabilities  edit  The research work of the CERTCC is split up into several different Work Areas.  5  Some key capabilities and products are listed below. Coordination  edit  The CERTCC works directly with software vendors in the private sector as well as government agencies to address software vulnerabilities and provide fixes to the public. This process is known as coordination. The CERTCC promotes a particular process of coordination known as Responsible Coordinated Disclosure . In this case the CERTCC works privately with the vendor to address the vulnerability before a public report is published usually jointly with the vendors own security advisory. In extreme cases when the vendor is unwilling to resolve the issue or cannot be contacted the CERTCC typically discloses information publicly 45 days after the first contact attempt.  6  Software vulnerabilities coordinated by the CERTCC may come from internal research or from outside reporting. Vulnerabilities discovered by outside individuals or organizations may be reported to the CERTCC using the CERTCCs Vulnerability Reporting Form.  7  Depending on the severity of the reported vulnerability the CERTCC may take further action to address the vulnerability and coordinate with the software vendor. Knowledge Base and Vulnerability Notes  edit  The CERTCC regularly publishes Vulnerability Notes in the CERT Knowledge Base.  8   9  Vulnerability Notes include information about recent vulnerabilities that were researched and coordinated and how individuals and organizations may mitigate such vulnerabilities. The Vulnerability Notes database is not meant to be comprehensive. Vulnerability Analysis Tools  edit  The CERTCC provides a number of free tools to the security research community.  10  Some tools offered include the following. CERT Tapiocaa preconfigured virtual appliance for performing maninthemiddle attacks. This can be used to analyze network traffic of software applications and determine if the software uses encryption correctly etc. BFF Basic Fuzzer Frameworka mutational file fuzzer for Linux FOE Failure Observation Enginea mutational file fuzzer for Windows DranzerMicrosoft ActiveX vulnerability discovery Training  edit  The CERTCC periodically offers training courses for researchers or organizations looking to establish their own PSIRTs.  11  Controversies  edit  In the summer of 2014 CERT research funded by the US Federal Government was key to the deanonymization of Tor  and information subpoenaed from CERT by the FBI was used to take down SilkRoad 2.0 that fall.  
FBI denied paying CMU to deanonymize users  12  and CMU denied receiving funding for its compliance with the governments subpoena.  13  Despite indirectly contributing to taking down numerous illicit websites and the arrest of at least 17 suspects the research raised multiple issues about computer security research ethics as a concern to the Tor community  14  and others  15  about being unreasonably searched online as related to the guarantee by the US 4th amendment  14  about SEI CERT acting at crosspurposes to its own missions actions including withholding the vulnerabilities it had found from the software implementers and the public.  15  CMU said in a statement in November 2015 that ...the university from time to time is served with subpoenas requesting information about research it has performed. The university abides by the rule of law complies with lawfully issued subpoenas and receives no funding for its compliance even though Motherboard reported that neither the FBI nor CMU explained how the authority first learned about the research and then subpoenaed for the appropriate information.  13  In the past SEI had also declined to explain the nature of this particular research in response to press inquiries saying Thanks for your inquiry but it is our practice not to comment on law enforcement investigations or court proceedings.  16  Further information Tor anonymity network  Relay early attack  and Operation Onymous  Tor 0day exploit See also  edit  CERT C Coding Standard Computer Emergency Response Team Computer security References  edit   About Us The CERT Division .
