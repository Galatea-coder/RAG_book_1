The measures involved can be passive such as obfuscation to make reverse engineering difficult or active tamperdetection techniques which aim to make a program malfunction or not operate at all if modified.  1  It is essentially tamper resistance implemented in the software domain. It shares certain aspects but also differs from related technologies like copy protection and trusted hardware though it is often used in combination with them. Antitampering technology typically makes the software somewhat larger and also has a performance impact. There are no provably secure software antitampering methods thus the field is an arms race between attackers and software antitampering technologies.  2  Tampering can be malicious to gain control over some aspect of the software with an unauthorized modification that alters the computer program code and behaviour. Examples include installing rootkits and backdoors  disabling security monitoring subverting authentication malicious code injection for the purposes of data theft or to achieve higher user privileges altering control flow and communication license code bypassing for the purpose of software piracy  code interference to extract data or algorithms  3  and counterfeiting. Software applications are vulnerable to the effects of tampering and code changes throughout their lifecycle from development and deployment to operation and maintenance.  citation needed  Antitamper protection can be applied as either internally or externally to the application being protected. External antitampering is normally accomplished by monitoring the software to detect tampering. This type of defense is commonly expressed as malware scanners and antivirus applications . Internal antitampering is used to turn an application into its own security system and is generally done with specific code within the software that will detect tampering as it happens. This type of tamper proofing defense may take the form of runtime integrity checks such as cyclic redundancy checksums   4  antidebugging measures encryption or obfuscation .  5  Execution inside a virtual machine has become a common antitamper method used in recent years for commercial software it is used for example in StarForce and SecuROM .  6  Some antitamper software uses whitebox cryptography  so cryptographic keys are not revealed even when cryptographic computations are being observed in complete detail in a debugger.  7  A more recent research trend is tampertolerant software which aims to correct the effects of tampering and allow the program to continue as if unmodified.  2  A simple and easily defeated scheme of this kind was used in the Diablo II video game which stored its critical player data in two copies at different memory locations and if one was modified externally the game used the lower value.  8  Antitamper software is used in many types of software products including embedded systems financial applications software for mobile devices networkappliance systems anticheating in games  military  9  license management software and digital rights management DRM systems. Some generalpurpose packages have been developed which can wrap existing code with minimal programing effort for example the SecuROM and similar kits used in the gaming industry though they have the downside that semigeneric attacking tools also exist to counter them.  10  Malicious software itself can and has been observed using antitampering techniques for example the Mariposa botnet .  11  See also  edit  Hardening computing Fault tolerance Denuvo Digital rights management References  edit   Arnold Michael Schmucker Martin Wolthusen Stephen D. 1 January 2003.
