List of permissions for a system resource In computer security  an accesscontrol list  ACL  is a list of permissions  a  associated with a system resource object or facility. An ACL specifies which users or system processes are granted access to resources as well as what operations are allowed on given resources.  1  Each entry in a typical ACL specifies a subject and an operation.  For instance If a file object has an ACL that contains Alice readwrite Bob read  this would give Alice permission to read and write the file and give Bob permission only to read it. If the RACF profile CONSOLE CLASSTSOAUTH has an ACL that contains ALICEREAD  this would give ALICE permission to use the TSO CONSOLE command. Implementations  edit  Many kinds of operating systems implement ACLs or have a historical implementation the first implementation of ACLs was in the filesystem of Multics in 1965.  2   3  Filesystem ACLs  edit  A filesystem ACL is a data structure usually a table containing entries that specify individual user or group rights to specific system objects such as programs processes  or files. These entries are known as accesscontrol entries ACEs in the Microsoft Windows NT   4  OpenVMS  and Unixlike operating systems such as Linux  macOS  and Solaris . Each accessible object contains an identifier to its ACL. The privileges or permissions determine specific access rights such as whether a user can read from write to or execute an object. In some implementations an ACE can control whether or not a user or group of users may alter the ACL on an object. One of the first operating systems to provide filesystem ACLs was Multics . PRIMOS featured ACLs at least as early as 1984.  5  In the 1990s the ACL and RBAC models were extensively tested  by whom  and used to administer file permissions. POSIX ACL  edit  POSIX 1003.1e1003.2c working group made an effort to standardize ACLs resulting in what is now known as POSIX.1e ACL or simply POSIX ACL.  6  The POSIX.1ePOSIX.2c drafts were withdrawn in 1997 due to participants losing interest for funding the project and turning to more powerful alternatives such as NFSv4 ACL.  7  As of December 2019 update  no live sources of the draft could be found on the Internet but it can still be found in the Internet Archive .  8  Most of the Unix and Unixlike operating systems e.g. Linux since 2.5.46 or November 2002  9  FreeBSD  or Solaris  support POSIX.1e ACLs not necessarily draft 17. ACLs are usually stored in the extended attributes of a file on these systems. NFSv4 ACL  edit  NFSv4 ACLs are much more powerful than POSIX draft ACLs. Unlike draft POSIX ACLs NFSv4 ACLs are defined by an actually published standard as part of the Network File System . NFSv4 ACLs are supported by many Unix and Unixlike operating systems. Examples include AIX  FreeBSD   10  Mac OS X beginning with version 10.4  Tiger  or Solaris with ZFS filesystem  11  support NFSv4 ACLs which are part of the NFSv4 standard. There are two experimental implementations of NFSv4 ACLs for Linux NFSv4 ACLs support for Ext3 filesystem  12  and the more recent Richacls  which brings NFSv4 ACLs support for Ext4 filesystem.  13  As with POSIX ACLs NFSv4 ACLs are usually stored as extended attributes on Unixlike systems. NFSv4 ACLs are organized nearly identically to the Windows NT ACLs used in NTFS .  14  NFSv4.1 ACLs are a superset of both NT ACLs and POSIX draft ACLs.  15  Samba supports saving the NT ACLs of SMBshared files in many ways one of which is as NFSv4encoded ACLs.  16  Active Directory ACLs  edit  Microsoft s Active Directory service implements an LDAP server that store and disseminate configuration information about users and computers in a domain.  17  Active Directory extends the LDAP specification by adding the same type of accesscontrol list mechanism as Windows NT uses for the NTFS filesystem. Windows 2000 then extended the syntax for accesscontrol entries such that they could not only grant or deny access to entire LDAP objects but also to individual attributes within these objects.  18  Networking ACLs  edit  On some types of proprietary computer hardware in particular routers and switches  an accesscontrol list provides rules that are applied to port numbers or IP addresses that are available on a host or other layer 3  each with a list of hosts andor networks permitted to use the service. Although it is additionally possible to configure accesscontrol lists based on network domain names  this is a questionable idea because individual TCP  UDP  and ICMP headers do not contain domain names. Consequently the device enforcing the accesscontrol list must separately resolve names to numeric addresses. This presents an additional attack surface for an attacker who is seeking to compromise security of the system which the accesscontrol list is protecting. Both individual servers and routers can have network ACLs. Accesscontrol lists can generally be configured to control both inbound and outbound traffic and in this context they are similar to firewalls . Like firewalls ACLs could be subject to security regulations and standards such as PCI DSS . SQL implementations  edit  ACL algorithms have been ported to SQL and to relational database systems . Many modern 2000s and 2010s SQL based systems like enterprise resource planning and content management systems have used ACL models in their administration modules. Comparing with RBAC  edit  The main alternative to the ACL model is the rolebased accesscontrol RBAC model.  A minimal RBAC model RBACm  can be compared with an ACL mechanism ACLg  where only groups are permitted as entries in the ACL. Barkley 1997  19  showed that RBACm and ACLg are equivalent. In modern SQL implementations ACLs also manage groups and inheritance in a hierarchy of groups. So modern ACLs can express all that RBAC express and are notably powerful compared to old ACLs in their ability to express accesscontrol policy in terms of the way in which administrators view organizations. For data interchange and for highlevel comparisons ACL data can be translated to XACML .  20  See also  edit  Access token manager Cacls Capabilitybased security Clist Confused deputy problem DACL Extended file attributes Filesystem permissions Privilege computing Rolebased access control RBAC Notes  edit   E.g.
