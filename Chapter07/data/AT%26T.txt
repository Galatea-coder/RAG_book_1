In 2005 ATT was among 53 entities that contributed the maximum of 250000 to the second inauguration of President George W. Bush .  119   120   121  Bill Leahy representing ATT sits on the Private Enterprise Board of the American Legislative Exchange Council ALEC.  122  ALEC is a nonprofit organization of conservative state legislators and private sector representatives that drafts and shares model statelevel legislation for distribution among state governments in the United States.  123   124   125  During the period of 1998 to 2019 the company expended US380.1 million on lobbying in the United States.  126  A key political issue for ATT has been the question of which businesses win the right to profit by providing broadband internet access in the United States.  127  The company has also lobbied in support of several federal bills. ATT supported the Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013 H.R. 3675 113th Congress  a bill that would make a number of changes to procedures that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission FCC follows in its rulemaking processes.  128  The FCC would have to act in a more transparent way as a result of this bill forced to accept public input about regulations.  129  ATTs Executive Vice President of Federal Relations Tim McKone said that the bills much needed institutional reforms will help arm the agency with the tools to keep pace with the Internet speed of todays marketplace. It will also ensure that outmoded regulatory practices for todays competitive marketplace are properly placed in the dustbin of history.  130  In May 2018 reports emerged that ATT made 12 monthly payments between January and December 2017 to Essential Consultants a company set up by President Donald Trump s lawyer Michael Cohen  totaling 600000.  131  Although initial reports on May 8 mentioned only four monthly payments totaling 200000  132  documents obtained by the Washington Post on May 10 confirmed the figure of 12 payments which had begun three days after the President was sworn into office .  133   134  ATT confirmed the report the same day.  135  The report from The Washington Post  as well as additional reporting from Bloomberg  revealed the payments had been made for Cohen to provide guidance relating to the attempted 85 billion merger with Time Warner   133   134  to gain information on the Trump administrations planned tax reforms as well as about potential changes to net neutrality policies under the new FCC.  136  Chairman of the FCC Ajit Pai denied Cohen ever inquired about net neutrality on ATTs behalf.  135   137  A spokesperson for ATT said that the company had been contacted by the Special Counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller regarding the payments and had provided all the information requested in November and December 2017.  138   139  In early 2019 the Democratic House Judiciary requested records related to the ATTTime Warner merger from the White House .  140  While it has expressed support for LGBTQ causes ATT has also donated to sponsors of antitransgender legislation in several US states especially those predominantly Republican governed including Arkansas Tennessee North Carolina Texas and Florida.  141   142   143  Historical financial performance  edit  The financial performance of the company is reported to shareholders on an annual basis and a matter of public record.

ATT employees work at High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area offices operated by the Office of National Drug Control Policy  in Los Angeles  Atlanta  and Houston so data can be quickly turned over to law enforcement agencies. Records are requested via an administrative subpoena without the involvement of a court or grand jury. Censorship  edit  In September 2007 ATT changed its legal policy to state that ATT may immediately terminate or suspend all or a portion of your Service any Member ID electronic mail address IP address Universal Resource Locator or domain name used by you without notice for conduct that ATT believes ... c tends to damage the name or reputation of ATT or its parents affiliates and subsidiaries.  162  By October 10 2007 ATT had altered the terms and conditions for its Internet service to explicitly support freedom of expression by its subscribers after an outcry claiming the company had given itself the right to censor its subscribers transmissions.  163  Privacy controversy  edit  Further information MAINWAY  Room 641A  Mark Klein  NSA warrantless surveillance controversy  and Hepting v. ATT Diagram of how alleged wiretapping worked from EFF court filings  164  In 2006 the Electronic Frontier Foundation lodged the class action lawsuit Hepting v. ATT  which alleged that ATT had allowed agents of the National Security Agency NSA to monitor phone and Internet communications of ATT customers without warrants. If true this would violate the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and the First and Fourth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution . ATT has yet to confirm or deny that monitoring by the NSA is occurring. In April 2006 retired former ATT technician Mark Klein lodged an affidavit supporting this allegation.  165   166  The US Department of Justice stated it would intervene in this lawsuit by means of State Secrets Privilege .  167  In July 2006 the United States District Court for the Northern District of California  in which the suit was filed  rejected a federal government motion to dismiss the case. The motion to dismiss which invoked the State Secrets Privilege had argued that any court review of the alleged partnership between the federal government and ATT would harm national security. The case was immediately appealed to the Ninth Circuit. It was dismissed on June 3 2009 citing retroactive legislation in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .  168   169  In May 2006 USA Today reported that all international and domestic calling records had been handed over to the National Security Agency by ATT Verizon SBC and BellSouth for the purpose of creating a massive calling database .  170  The portions of the new ATT that had been part of SBC Communications before November 18 2005 were not mentioned. On June 21 2006 the San Francisco Chronicle reported that ATT had rewritten rules on its privacy policy. The policy which took effect June 23 2006 says that ATT  not customers  owns customers confidential info and can use it to protect its legitimate business interests safeguard others or respond to legal process.  171  On August 22 2007 National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell confirmed that ATT was one of the telecommunications companies that assisted with the governments warrantless wiretapping program on calls between foreign and domestic sources.  172  On November 8 2007 Mark Klein a former ATT technician told Keith Olbermann of MSNBC that all Internet traffic passing over ATT lines was copied into a locked room at the companys San Francisco office  to which only employees with National Security Agency clearance had access.  173  ATT keeps for five to seven years a record of who text messages whom and the date and time but not the content of the messages.  174  ATT has a one star privacy rating from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  175  Copyright enforcement  edit  In January 2008 reports emerged that the company planned to begin filtering all Internet traffic which passed through its network for intellectual property violations.  176  Media commentators speculated that if this plan was implemented it would have led to a mass exodus of subscribers from ATT  177  although Internet traffic of nonsubscribers may have gone through the companys network anyway.  176  Internet freedom proponents used these developments as justification for governmentmandated network neutrality . Under ATTs current copyright enforcement program content owners may notify ATT when they allege unlawful sharing of material. The program is based on IP addresses visible to content owners in peertopeer networks not on filtering. ATT has terminated the broadband service of some customers accused of copyright infringement.  178  Discrimination against local publicaccess television channels  edit  In 2009 ATT was accused by community media groups of discriminating against local public educational and government access PEG cable TV channels by impictions that will severely restrict the audience.  179  According to Barbara Popovic executive director of the Chicago publicaccess service CANTV  the new ATT Uverse system forced all Publicaccess television into a special menu system denying normal functionality such as channel numbers access to the standard program guide  and DVR recording.  179  The Ratepayer Advocates division of the California Public Utilities Commission reported Instead of putting the stations on individual channels ATT has bundled community stations into a generic channel that can only be navigated through a complex and lengthy process.  179  Sue Buske president of telecommunications consulting firm the Buske Group and a former head of the National Federation of Local Cable Programmers Alliance for Community Media  argue that this is an overall attack ... on public access across the United States the place in the dial around cities and communities where people can make their own media in their own communities.  179  Information security  edit  In June 2010 a hacker group known as Goatse Security discovered a vulnerability within ATT that could allow anyone to uncover email addresses belonging to customers of ATT 3G service for the Apple iPad .  180  These email addresses could be accessed without a protective password.  181  Using a script Goatse Security collected thousands of email addresses from ATT.  180  Goatse Security informed ATT about the security flaw through a third party.  182  Goatse Security then disclosed around 114000 of these emails to Gawker Media  which published an article about the security flaw and disclosure in Valleywag .  180   182  Praetorian Security Group criticized the web application that Goatse Security exploited as poorly designed.  180  In April 2015 ATT was fined 25 million over data security breaches marking the largest ever fine issued by the Federal Communications Commission FCC for breaking data privacy laws. The investigation revealed the theft of details of approximately 280000 people from call centers in Mexico Colombia and the Philippines .  183   184  In March 2024 ATT confirmed the 2021 leak of contact information for over 7.6 million current users as well as 65 million former ones. The leaked records may contain full name email address mailing address phone number social security number date of birth ATT account number and passcode.  185  Multiple classaction lawsuits have been filed as a result of this.  186   187  In July 2024 the company stated it experienced a new breach the largest to date. The company is expected to notify around 110 million customers who were affected.  188  Accusations of enabling fraud  edit  In March 2012 the United States federal government announced a lawsuit against ATT. The specific accusations state that ATT violated the False Claims Act by facilitating and seeking federal payment for IP Relay calls by international callers who were ineligible for the service and sought to use it for fraudulent purposes. The complaint alleges that out of fears that fraudulent call volume would drop after the registration deadline ATT knowingly adopted a noncompliant registration system that did not verify whether the user was located within the United States. The complaint further contends that ATT continued to employ this system even with the knowledge that it facilitated the use of IP Relay by fraudulent foreign callers which accounted for up to 95 percent of ATTs call volume. The governments complaint alleges that ATT improperly billed the TRS Fund for reimbursement of these calls and received millions of dollars in federal payments as a result.  189  In 2013 ATT entered into a consent decree with the FCC and paid a total of 21.75 million.  190  Aaron Slator controversy  edit  On April 28 2015 ATT announced that it had fired Aaron Slator President of Content and Advertising Sales for sending text messages critics described as racist.  191  AfricanAmerican employee Knoyme King filed a 100 million defamation lawsuit against Slator.  192  The day before that protesters arrived at ATTs headquarters in Dallas and its satellite offices in Los Angeles as well as at the home of CEO Randall Stephenson to protest alleged systemic racial policies. According to accounts the protesters demanded that ATT begin working with 100 blackowned media companies.  193  On January 24 2017 Slator sued ATT in the Los Angeles Superior Court  accusing the company of defamation and wrongful termination. Slator had been involved in organizing ATTs planned 48.5 billion acquisition of DirecTV since 2014 and he claimed that when news headlines speculated that his text messages could prevent the acquisition from going through he was fired as a scapegoat by company executives. He also claimed that the executives had known about the text messages since at least late 2013 and had promised him at the time that he would not be fired for them.  194   195  The company stood by its decision to terminate Slator.  196  Overcharging government agencies  edit  In 2020 ATT paid out 48 million to settle a lawsuit with 30 government entities. The suit under the California False Claims Act related to contractual undertakings to provide services at the lowest cost available. ATT denied any wrongdoing in the matter.  197  One America News Network  edit  An investigative report by Reuters in 2021 revealed that ATT played a key role in creating funding and sustaining One America News Network OAN a farright TV network known for promoting conspiracy theories .  198  According to 2020 sworn testimony by an OAN accountant 90 of OANs revenue came from ATT. According to OAN founder Robert Herring Sr.  ATT wanted to create a conservative network to compete with Fox News . Court documents showed OAN promised to cast a positive light on ATT during newscasts. ATT denied the allegations.  199   200  Comedian John Oliver criticized ATT in his weekly show for funding OAN.  201  Leaking data to Wall Street  edit  In March 2021 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filed suit against ATT and three of its executives for violating the Fair Disclosure Rule against making selective disclosures of material nonpublic information to analysts and others. The SEC alleged that beginning in early 2016 these executives leaked key information to Wall Street analysts in order to manipulate revenue forecasts for the company.  202  In December 2022 without acknowledging any guilt ATT agreed to pay 6.25 million in fines to settle the lawsuit. The individual executives were also on the hook for 25000 each.  202   203  Bribery to influence legislation  edit  In October 2022 ATT agreed to pay a 23 million fine to resolve a federal criminal investigation into the companys efforts to unlawfully influence former Illinois Speaker of the House Michael J. Madigan .  204  Under a deferred prosecution with the US Department of Justice  ATT admitted that it arranged for payments to an ally of Madigan in order to influence Madigans vote in 2017 on legislation that would eliminate ATTs socalled Carrier of Last Resort obligation to provide landline telephone service to all Illinois residents which was expected to save the company millions of dollars.  204  Madigan also helped to defeat an amendment to a bill that became law in 2018 regarding fees for small cell tower attachments that would have been harmful to ATTs interests.  205  Former ATT Illinois President Paul La Schiazza who is set to go on trial in September 2024 for the alleged bribery scheme described ATTs quid pro quo relationship with Madigan in an email to an ATT employee as the friends and family plan.  205  2024 outage  edit  On February 22 2024 cellular service was disrupted across the United States with millions unable to connect to the cellular network.  206  Municipalities reported that ATT customers were unable to place calls to emergency services even when using their phones SOS capability.  207  The blackout prompted the FBI and Department of Homeland Security to launch investigations into the possibility of a cyber attack being the cause of the blackout.  208  ATT later claimed that the cause was instead a poorly timed server update.  209  Users were later compensated credit as a result of the outage.  210  In March the FCC opened an investigation into the outage.  206  2024 Data Breach Fine On September 18 2024 ATT was fined 13 million by the Federal Trade Commission FTC following a major data breach that exposed millions of customers personal information. The FTC found that ATT failed to implement adequate cybersecurity measures and did not promptly notify affected individuals. As part of the settlement ATT is required to enhance its data protection practices and provide identity theft protection to those impacted.  211  Naming rights and sponsorships  edit  Buildings  edit  ATT Midtown Center in Atlanta  Georgia Whitacre Tower One ATT Plaza  corporate headquarters Dallas  Texas ATT 220 Building  building in Indianapolis  Indiana ATT Building  building in Detroit Michigan ATT Building  building in Indianapolis Indiana ATT Building  building in Kingman Arizona ATT Building  aka The Batman Building in Nashville Tennessee ATT Building  building in Omaha Nebraska ATT Building Addition  building in Detroit Michigan ATT Building  building in San Diego ATT Center  building in Los Angeles ATT Center  building in St. Louis Missouri ATT City Center  building in Birmingham Alabama ATT Corporate Center  building in Chicago Illinois ATT Huron Road Building  skyscraper in Cleveland  Ohio ATT Lenox Park Campus  ATT Mobility Headquarters in DeKalb County just outside Atlanta Georgia ATT Midtown Center  building in Atlanta Georgia ATT Switching Center  building in Los Angeles ATT Switching Center  building in Oakland California ATT Switching Center  building in San Francisco ATT Tower  building in Minneapolis Minnesota ATT Building  building in Meriden Connecticut ATT Entertainment Group HQ  DirecTV corporate campus in El Segundo California Venues  edit  ATT Field  Chattanooga Tennessee formerly BellSouth Park  ATT Plaza  Chicago  Illinois public space that hosts the Cloud Gate sculpture in Millennium Park  ATT Performing Arts Center  Dallas Texas ATT Stadium  Arlington Texas formerly Cowboys Stadium  ATT Stadium  Glen Jean West Virginia outdoor openseating stadium at the Boy Scouts of America s Summit Bechtel Reserve  Jones ATT Stadium  Lubbock Texas formerly Clifford B. and Audrey Jones Stadium  Jones SBC Stadium  Sponsorships  edit  100 Thieves  212  esports ATT Byron Nelson  Irving Texas golf ATT Pebble Beach National ProAm golf Capitanes de Ciudad de México basketball Chicago Bulls  213  basketball College Football Playoff National Championship  214  Dallas Stars  215  ice hockey Houston Rockets  213  basketball Major League Soccer and the United States Soccer Federation  including the U.S. mens and U.S. womens national teams and the Major League Soccer AllStar Game from 2009 Mexico national football team National Collegiate Athletic Association Corporate Champion  216  National Basketball Association   217  Womens National Basketball Association   218  NBA G League   219  USA Basketball  219  and NBA 2K League  220  basketball esports BMW Sauber Formula One racing team  2005  221  Scuderia Ferrari Formula One racing team  2005  221  Williams Racing Formula One racing team  2007 to 2011 Red Bull Racing Formula One racing team  technical support and sponsorship 2011 to 2020  222  Cloud9  sponsorship since March 2019  223   224  Club América  sponsorship since July 19 2018 See also  edit  List of public corporations by market capitalization List of largest companies by revenue List of United States telephone companies List of mobile network operators in the United States List of telecommunications companies List of Internet exchange points List of public utilities Bell System Breakup of the Bell System United States v.

Verizon on the other hand keeps some information for up to a year that can be used to ascertain if a particular phone visited a particular Web site. According to the sheet Sprint Nextel Corp.s Virgin Mobile brand keeps the text content of text messages for three months. Verizon keeps it for three to five days. None of the other carriers keep texts at all but they keep records of who texted who for more than a year. The document says ATT keeps for five to seven years a record of who text messages who and when but not the content of the messages. Virgin Mobile only keeps that data for two to three months.
