Black Hat brings together a variety of people interested in information security ranging from nontechnical individuals executives hackers  and security professionals. The conference takes place regularly in Las Vegas  Barcelona  London and Riyadh but has also been hosted in Amsterdam  Tokyo  and Washington D.C. in the past.  1   2  History  edit  The first Black Hat was held July 710 1997 in Las Vegas immediately prior to DEF CON 5.  3  The conference was aimed at the computer industry promising to give them privileged insight into the minds and motivations of their hacker adversaries. Its organizers stated While many conferences focus on information and network security only the Black Hat Briefings will put your engineers and software programmers facetoface with todays cutting edge computer security experts and  hackers .  4  It was presented by DEF CON Communications and Cambridge Technology Partners. It was founded by Jeff Moss  who also founded DEF CON and is currently the Conference Chair of the Black Hat Review Board.  5  Black Hat started as a single annual conference in Las Vegas  Nevada and is now held in multiple locations around the world.  6  Black Hat Briefings was acquired by CMP Media  a subsidiary of U.K.based United Business Media UBM in 2005  7   8  which was then acquired by Informa Tech in June 2018. Components  edit  The conference is composed of three major sections which include briefings trainings and arsenal. Briefings  edit  The Briefings are composed of tracks covering various topics including reverse engineering  identity and privacy and hacking. The briefings also contain keynote speeches from leading voices in the information security field including Robert Lentz Chief Security Officer  United States Department of Defense  Michael Lynn Amit Yoran  former Director of the National Cyber Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security   2   9  and General Keith B. Alexander  former Director of the National Security Agency and former commander of the United States Cyber Command .  10  Trainings  edit  Training is offered by various computer security vendors and individual security professionals. The conference has hosted the National Security Agency s information assurance manager course and various courses by Cisco Systems  Offensive Security   11  and others.  12   13  Arsenal  edit  Arsenal is a portion of the conference dedicated to giving researchers and the open source community a place to showcase their latest opensource information security tools. Arsenal primarily consists of live tool demonstrations in a setting where attendees can ask questions about the tools and sometimes use them. It was added in 2010.  14  ToolsWatch maintains an archive of all Black Hat Briefings Arsenals.  15  Notable incidents  edit  Michael Lynn presenting a briefing in 2005 Black Hat had historically been known for the antics of its hacker contingent and the disclosures brought in its talks. In the past companies have attempted to ban researchers from disclosing vital information about their products. At Black Hat USA in 2005 Cisco Systems tried to stop Michael Lynn from speaking about a vulnerability that he said could let hackers virtually shut down the Internet.  2  However in recent years researchers have worked with vendors to resolve issues and some vendors have challenged hackers to attack their products.  16   17   18   19  Conference attendees had been known to hijack wireless connections of the hotels hack hotel television billing systems and in one instance deploy a fake automated teller machine in a hotel lobby.  20  In 2009 web sites belonging to a handful of security researchers and groups were hacked and passwords private emails instant messaging chats and sensitive documents were exposed on the vandalized site of Dan Kaminsky  days before the conference. During Black Hat USA in 2009 a USB thumb drive that was passed around among attendees was found to be infected with the Conficker virus  and in 2008 three men were expelled for packet sniffing the press room local area network .  21  Venues dates and locations  edit  Black Hat had initially started within the United States but expanded over the years across USA Europe Asia Middle East Africa
