Anomalies were initially searched for clear rejection or omission from the data to aid statistical analysis for example to compute the mean or standard deviation. They were also removed to better predictions from models such as linear regression and more recently their removal aids the performance of machine learning algorithms. However in many applications anomalies themselves are of interest and are the observations most desirous in the entire data set which need to be identified and separated from noise or irrelevant outliers. Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist.  1  Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as normal and abnormal and involves training a classifier. However this approach is rarely used in anomaly detection due to the general unavailability of labelled data and the inherent unbalanced nature of the classes. Semisupervised anomaly detection techniques assume that some portion of the data is labelled. This may be any combination of the normal or anomalous data but more often than not the techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model. Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques assume the data is unlabelled and are by far the most commonly used due to their wider and relevant application. Definition  edit  Many attempts have been made in the statistical and computer science communities to define an anomaly. The most prevalent ones include the following and can be categorised into three groups those that are ambiguous those that are specific to a method with predefined thresholds usually chosen empirically and those that are formally defined Ill defined  edit  An outlier is an observation which deviates so much from the other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism.  2  Anomalies are instances or collections of data that occur very rarely in the data set and whose features differ significantly from most of the data. An outlier is an observation or subset of observations which appears to be inconsistent with the remainder of that set of data.  3  An anomaly is a point or collection of points that is relatively distant from other points in multidimensional space of features. Anomalies are patterns in data that do not conform to a welldefined notion of normal behaviour.  1  Specific  edit  Let T be observations from a univariate Gaussian distribution and O a point from T. Then the zscore for O is greater than a preselected threshold if and only if O is an outlier. History  edit  Intrusion detection  edit  The concept of intrusion detection a critical component of anomaly detection has evolved significantly over time. Initially it was a manual process where system administrators would monitor for unusual activities such as a vacationing users account being accessed or unexpected printer activity. This approach was not scalable and was soon superseded by the analysis of audit logs and system logs for signs of malicious behavior.  4  By the late 1970s and early 1980s the analysis of these logs was primarily used retrospectively to investigate incidents as the volume of data made it impractical for realtime monitoring. The affordability of digital storage eventually led to audit logs being analyzed online with specialized programs being developed to sift through the data. These programs however were typically run during offpeak hours due to their computational intensity.  4  The 1990s brought the advent of realtime intrusion detection systems capable of analyzing audit data as it was generated allowing for immediate detection of and response to attacks. This marked a significant shift towards proactive intrusion detection.  4  As the field has continued to develop the focus has shifted to creating solutions that can be efficiently implemented across large and complex network environments adapting to the evergrowing variety of security threats and the dynamic nature of modern computing infrastructures.  4  Applications  edit  Anomaly detection is applicable in a very large number and variety of domains and is an important subarea of unsupervised machine learning. As such it has applications in cybersecurity intrusion detection  fraud detection  fault detection system health monitoring event detection in sensor networks detecting ecosystem disturbances defect detection in images using machine vision  medical diagnosis and law enforcement.  5  Intrusion detection  edit  Anomaly detection was proposed for intrusion detection systems IDS by Dorothy Denning in 1986.  6  Anomaly detection for IDS is normally accomplished with thresholds and statistics but can also be done with soft computing  and inductive learning.  7  Types of features proposed by 1999 included profiles of users workstations networks remote hosts groups of users and programs based on frequencies means variances covariances and standard deviations.  8  The counterpart of anomaly detection in intrusion detection is misuse detection . Fintech fraud detection  edit  Anomaly detection is vital in fintech for fraud prevention.  9   10  Preprocessing  edit  Preprocessing data to remove anomalies can be an important step in data analysis and is done for a number of reasons. Statistics such as the mean and standard deviation are more accurate after the removal of anomalies and the visualisation of data can also be improved. In supervised learning  removing the anomalous data from the dataset often results in a statistically significant increase in accuracy.  11   12  Video surveillance  edit  Anomaly detection has become increasingly vital in video surveillance to enhance security and safety.  13   14  With the advent of deep learning technologies methods using Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs and Simple Recurrent Units SRUs have shown significant promise in identifying unusual activities or behaviors in video data.  13  These models can process and analyze extensive video feeds in realtime recognizing patterns that deviate from the norm which may indicate potential security threats or safety violations.  13  An important aspect for video surveillance is the developement of scalable realtime frameworks.  15   16  Such pipelines are required for processing multiple video streams with low computational resources. IT infrastructure  edit  In IT infrastructure management anomaly detection is crucial for ensuring the smooth operation and reliability of services.  17  Techniques like the IT Infrastructure Library ITIL and monitoring frameworks are employed to track and manage system performance and user experience.  17  Detection anomalies can help identify and preempt potential performance degradations or system failures thus maintaining productivity and business process effectiveness.  17  IoT systems  edit  Anomaly detection is critical for the security and efficiency of Internet of Things IoT systems.  18  It helps in identifying system failures and security breaches in complex networks of IoT devices.  18  The methods must manage realtime data diverse device types and scale effectively. Garbe et al.  19  have introduced a multistage anomaly detection framework that improves upon traditional methods by incorporating spatial clustering densitybased clustering and localitysensitive hashing. This tailored approach is designed to better handle the vast and varied nature of IoT data thereby enhancing security and operational reliability in smart infrastructure and industrial IoT systems.  19  Petroleum industry  edit  Anomaly detection is crucial in the petroleum industry for monitoring critical machinery.  20  Martí et al. used a novel segmentation algorithm to analyze sensor data for realtime anomaly detection.  20  This approach helps promptly identify and address any irregularities in sensor readings ensuring the reliability and safety of petroleum operations.  20  Oil and gas pipeline monitoring  edit  In the oil and gas sector anomaly detection is not just crucial for maintenance and safety but also for environmental protection.  21  Aljameel et al. propose an advanced machine learningbased model for detecting minor leaks in oil and gas pipelines a task traditional methods may miss.  21  Methods  edit  Many anomaly detection techniques have been proposed in literature.  1   22  The performance of methods usually depend on the data sets. For example some may be suited to detecting local outliers while others global and methods have little systematic advantages over another when compared across many data sets.  23   24  Almost all algorithms also require the setting of nonintuitive parameters critical for performance and usually unknown before application. Some of the popular techniques are mentioned below and are broken down into categories Statistical  edit  Parameterfree  edit  Also referred to as frequencybased or countingbased the simplest nonparametric anomaly detection method is to build a histogram with the training data or a set of known normal instances and if a test point does not fall in any of the histogram bins mark it as anomalous or assign an anomaly score to test data based on the height of the bin it falls in.  1  The size of bins are key to the effectiveness of this technique but must be determined by the implementer. A more sophisticated technique uses kernel functions to approximate the distribution of the normal data.  Instances in low probability areas of the distribution are then considered anomalies  25  .

For instance CNNs can be trained on image datasets to identify atypical patterns indicative of defects or outofnorm conditions in industrial quality control scenarios.  43  Simple Recurrent Units SRUs In timeseries data SRUs a type of recurrent neural network have been effectively used for anomaly detection by capturing temporal dependencies and sequence anomalies.  13  Unlike traditional RNNs SRUs are designed to be faster and more parallelizable offering a better fit for realtime anomaly detection in complex systems such as dynamic financial markets or predictive maintenance in machinery where identifying temporal irregularities promptly is crucial.  44  Foundation models  Since the advent of largescale foundation models that have been used successfully on most downstream tasks they have also been adapted for use in anomaly detection and segmentation. Methods utilizing pretrained foundation models inclue using the alignment of image and text embeddings CLIP etc. for anomaly localization  45  while others may use the inpainting ability of generative image models for reconstructionerror based anomaly detection.  46  Clusterbased  edit  Clustering Cluster analysis based outlier detection  47   48  Deviations from association rules and frequent itemsets Fuzzy logicbased outlier detection Ensembles  edit  Ensemble techniques  using feature bagging   49   50  score normalization  51   52  and different sources of diversity  53   54  Others  edit  Histogrambased Outlier Score HBOS uses value histograms and assumes feature independence for fast predictions.  55  Anomaly detection in dynamic networks  edit  Dynamic networks such as those representing financial systems social media interactions and transportation infrastructure are subject to constant change making anomaly detection within them a complex task. Unlike static graphs dynamic networks reflect evolving relationships and states requiring adaptive techniques for anomaly detection. Types of anomalies in dynamic networks  edit  Community anomalies Compression anomalies Decomposition anomalies Distance anomalies Probabilistic model anomalies Explainable anomaly detection  edit  Many of the methods discussed above only yield an anomaly score prediction which often can be explained to users as the point being in a region of low data density or relatively low density compared to the neighbors densities. In explainable artificial intelligence  the users demand methods with higher explainability. Some methods allow for more detailed explanations The Subspace Outlier Degree SOD  33  identifies attributes where a sample is normal and attributes in which the sample deviates from the expected. Correlation Outlier Probabilities COP  34  compute an error vector of how a sample point deviates from an expected location which can be interpreted as a counterfactual explanation the sample would be normal if it were moved to that location.
