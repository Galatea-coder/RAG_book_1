Classification system for computer science topics The ACM Computing Classification System  CCS  is a subject classification system for computing devised by the Association for Computing Machinery ACM. The system is comparable to the Mathematics Subject Classification MSC in scope aims and structure being used by the various ACM journals to organize subjects by area. History  edit  The system has gone through seven revisions the first version being published in 1964 and revised versions appearing in 1982 1983 1987 1991 1998 and the now current version in 2012. Structure  edit  It is hierarchically structured in four levels. For example one branch of the hierarchy contains Computing methodologies Artificial intelligence Knowledge representation and reasoning Ontology engineering See also  edit  Computer Science Ontology Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme arXiv  a preprint server allowing submitted papers to be classified using the ACM CCS Physics Subject Headings References  edit  Coulter Neal 1997 ACMs computing classification system reflects changing times Communications of the ACM  40 12 New York NY USA ACM 111 112 doi  10.1145265563.265579  S2CID 42548816 .

The ACM Computing Research Repository uses a classification scheme that is much coarser than the ACM subject classification and does not cover all areas of CS but is intended to better cover active areas of research. In addition papers in this repository are classified according to the ACM subject classification. v t e Computer science Note This template roughly follows the 2012 ACM Computing Classification System .
