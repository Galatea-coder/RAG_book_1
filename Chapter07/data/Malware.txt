Malware can be designed to evade antivirus software detection algorithms.  8  History  edit  Main article History of computer viruses For a chronological guide see Timeline of computer viruses and worms . The notion of a selfreproducing computer program can be traced back to initial theories about the operation of complex automata.  11  John von Neumann showed that in theory a program could reproduce itself. This constituted a plausibility result in computability theory . Fred Cohen experimented with computer viruses and confirmed Neumanns postulate and investigated other properties of malware such as detectability and selfobfuscation using rudimentary encryption. His 1987 doctoral dissertation was on the subject of computer viruses.  12  The combination of cryptographic technology as part of the payload of the virus exploiting it for attack purposes was initialized and investigated from the mid1990s and includes initial ransomware and evasion ideas.  13  Before Internet access became widespread viruses spread on personal computers by infecting executable programs or boot sectors of floppy disks. By inserting a copy of itself into the machine code instructions in these programs or boot sectors  a virus causes itself to be run whenever the program is run or the disk is booted. Early computer viruses were written for the Apple II and Mac  but they became more widespread with the dominance of the IBM PC and MSDOS . The first IBM PC virus in the wild was a boot sector virus dubbed cBrain  created in 1986 by the Farooq Alvi brothers in Pakistan.  14  Malware distributors would trick the user into booting or running from an infected device or medium. For example a virus could make an infected computer add autorunnable code to any USB stick plugged into it. Anyone who then attached the stick to another computer set to autorun from USB would in turn become infected and also pass on the infection in the same way.  15  Older email software would automatically open HTML email containing potentially malicious JavaScript code. Users may also execute disguised malicious email attachments. The 2018 Data Breach Investigations Report by Verizon  cited by CSO Online  states that emails are the primary method of malware delivery accounting for 96 of malware delivery around the world.  16   17  The first worms network borne infectious programs originated not on personal computers but on multitasking Unix systems. The first wellknown worm was the Morris worm of 1988 which infected SunOS and VAX BSD systems. Unlike a virus this worm did not insert itself into other programs. Instead it exploited security holes  vulnerabilities  in network server programs and started itself running as a separate process .  18  This same behavior is used by todays worms as well.  19  With the rise of the Microsoft Windows platform in the 1990s and the flexible macros of its applications it became possible to write infectious code in the macro language of Microsoft Word and similar programs. These macro viruses infect documents and templates rather than applications  executables  but rely on the fact that macros in a Word document are a form of executable code.  20  Many early infectious programs including the Morris Worm  the first internet worm were written as experiments or pranks.  21  Today malware is used by both black hat hackers and governments to steal personal financial or business information.  22   23  Today any device that plugs into a USB port  even lights fans speakers toys or peripherals such as a digital microscope  can be used to spread malware. Devices can be infected during manufacturing or supply if quality control is inadequate.  15  Purposes  edit  Since the rise of widespread broadband Internet access malicious software has more frequently been designed for profit. Since 2003 the majority of widespread viruses and worms have been designed to take control of users computers for illicit purposes.  24  Infected  zombie computers  can be used to send email spam  to host contraband data such as child pornography   25  or to engage in distributed denialofservice attacks as a form of extortion .  26  Malware is used broadly against government or corporate websites to gather sensitive information  27  or to disrupt their operation in general. Further malware can be used against individuals to gain information such as personal identification numbers or details bank or credit card numbers and passwords.  28   29  In addition to criminal moneymaking malware can be used for sabotage often for political motives. Stuxnet  for example was designed to disrupt very specific industrial equipment. There have been politically motivated attacks which spread over and shut down large computer networks including massive deletion of files and corruption of master boot records  described as computer killing. Such attacks were made on Sony Pictures Entertainment 25 November 2014 using malware known as Shamoon or W32.Disttrack and Saudi Aramco August 2012.  30   31  Types  edit  Malware can be classified in numerous ways and certain malicious programs may fall into two or more categories simultaneously.  1  Broadly software can categorised into three types  32  i goodware ii greyware and iii malware. Classification of potentially malicious software Data sourced from MolinaCoronado et al. 2023  32  Type Characteristics Examples Notes Goodware Obtained from trustworthy source Google Play apps Buggy software Greyware Insufficient consensus andor metrics Potentially unwanted programs Spyware Adware Malware Broad consensus among antivirus software that program is malicious or obtained from flagged sources. Viruses Worms Root kits Backdoors Ransomware Trojan horses Malware  edit  Hex dump of the Blaster worm  showing a message left for Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates by the worms programmer Virus  edit  Main article Computer virus A computer virus is software usually hidden within another seemingly innocuous program that can produce copies of itself and insert them into other programs or files and that usually performs a harmful action such as destroying data.  33  They have been likened to biological viruses .  3  An example of this is a portable execution infection a technique usually used to spread malware that inserts extra data or executable code into PE files .  34  A computer virus is software that embeds itself in some other executable software including the operating system itself on the target system without the users knowledge and consent and when it is run the virus is spread to other executable files. Worm  edit  A worm is a standalone malware software that actively transmits itself over a network to infect other computers and can copy itself without infecting files. These definitions lead to the observation that a virus requires the user to run an infected software or operating system for the virus to spread whereas a worm spreads itself.  35  Rootkits  edit  Main article Rootkit Once malicious software is installed on a system it is essential that it stays concealed to avoid detection. Software packages known as rootkits allow this concealment by modifying the hosts operating system so that the malware is hidden from the user. Rootkits can prevent a harmful process from being visible in the systems list of processes  or keep its files from being read.  36  Some types of harmful software contain routines to evade identification andor removal attempts not merely to hide themselves. An early example of this behavior is recorded in the Jargon File tale of a pair of programs infesting a Xerox CPV time sharing system Each ghostjob would detect the fact that the other had been killed and would start a new copy of the recently stopped program within a few milliseconds. The only way to kill both ghosts was to kill them simultaneously very difficult or to deliberately crash the system.  37  Backdoors  edit  Main article Backdoor computing A backdoor is a broad term for a computer program that allows an attacker persistent unauthorised remote access to a victims machine often without their knowledge.  38  The attacker typically uses another attack such as a trojan  worm or virus  to bypass authentication mechanisms usually over an unsecured network such as the Internet to install the backdoor application. A backdoor can also be a side effect of a software bug in legitimate software that is exploited by an attacker to gain access to a victims computer or network. The idea has often been suggested that computer manufacturers preinstall backdoors on their systems to provide technical support for customers but this has never been reliably verified. It was reported in 2014 that US government agencies had been diverting computers purchased by those considered targets to secret workshops where software or hardware permitting remote access by the agency was installed considered to be among the most productive operations to obtain access to networks around the world.  39  Backdoors may be installed by Trojan horses worms  implants  or other methods.  40   41  Trojan horse  edit  A Trojan horse misrepresents itself to masquerade as a regular benign program or utility in order to persuade a victim to install it. A Trojan horse usually carries a hidden destructive function that is activated when the application is started. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the Trojan horse used to invade the city of Troy by stealth.  42   43  Trojan horses are generally spread by some form of social engineering  for example where a user is duped into executing an email attachment disguised to be unsuspicious e.g. a routine form to be filled in or by driveby download . Although their payload can be anything many modern forms act as a backdoor contacting a controller phoning home which can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer potentially installing additional software such as a keylogger to steal confidential information cryptomining software or adware to generate revenue to the operator of the trojan.  44  While Trojan horses and backdoors are not easily detectable by themselves computers may appear to run slower emit more heat or fan noise due to heavy processor or network usage as may occur when cryptomining software is installed. Cryptominers may limit resource usage andor only run during idle times in an attempt to evade detection. Unlike computer viruses and worms Trojan horses generally do not attempt to inject themselves into other files or otherwise propagate themselves.  45  In spring 2017 Mac users were hit by the new version of Proton Remote Access Trojan RAT  46  trained to extract password data from various sources such as browser autofill data the MacOS keychain and password vaults.  47  Droppers  edit  Main article Dropper malware Droppers are a subtype of Trojans that solely aim to deliver malware upon the system that they infect with the desire to subvert detection through stealth and a light payload.  48  It is important not to confuse a dropper with a loader or stager. A loader or stager will merely load an extension of the malware for example a collection of malicious functions through reflective dynamic link library injection into memory. The purpose is to keep the initial stage light and undetectable. A dropper merely downloads further malware to the system. Ransomware  edit  Main article Ransomware Ransomware prevents a user from accessing their files until a ransom is paid. There are two variations of ransomware being crypto ransomware and locker ransomware.  49  Locker ransomware just locks down a computer system without encrypting its contents whereas crypto ransomware locks down a system and encrypts its contents. For example programs such as CryptoLocker encrypt files securely and only decrypt them on payment of a substantial sum of money.  50  Lockscreens or screen lockers is a type of cyber police ransomware that blocks screens on Windows or Android devices with a false accusation in harvesting illegal content trying to scare the victims into paying up a fee.  51  Jisut and SLocker impact Android devices more than other lockscreens with Jisut making up nearly 60 percent of all Android ransomware detections.  52  Encryptionbased ransomware like the name suggests is a type of ransomware that encrypts all files on an infected machine. These types of malware then display a popup informing the user that their files have been encrypted and that they must pay usually in Bitcoin to recover them. Some examples of encryptionbased ransomware are CryptoLocker and WannaCry .  53  Click Fraud  edit  Some malware is used to generate money by click fraud  making it appear that the computer user has clicked an advertising link on a site generating a payment from the advertiser. It was estimated in 2012 that about 60 to 70 of all active malware used some kind of click fraud and 22 of all adclicks were fraudulent.  54  Grayware  edit  See also Privacyinvasive software and Potentially unwanted program Grayware is any unwanted application or file that can worsen the performance of computers and may cause security risks but which there is insufficient consensus or data to classify them as malware.  32  Types of greyware typically includes spyware  adware  fraudulent dialers  joke programs jokeware and remote access tools .  38  For example at one point Sony BMG compact discs silently installed a rootkit on purchasers computers with the intention of preventing illicit copying.  55  Potentially unwanted program  edit  Potentially unwanted programs PUPs are applications that would be considered unwanted despite often being intentionally downloaded by the user.  56  PUPs include spyware adware and fraudulent dialers. Many security products classify unauthorised key generators as PUPs although they frequently carry true malware in addition to their ostensible purpose.  57  In fact Kammerstetter et al. 2012  57  estimated that as much as 55 of key generators could contain malware and that about 36 malicious key generators were not detected by antivirus software. Adware  edit  Some types of adware turn off antimalware and virus protection technical remedies are available.  58  Spyware  edit  Programs designed to monitor users web browsing display unsolicited advertisements  or redirect affiliate marketing revenues are called spyware . Spyware programs do not spread like viruses instead they are generally installed by exploiting security holes. They can also be hidden and packaged together with unrelated userinstalled software.  59  The Sony BMG rootkit was intended to prevent illicit copying but also reported on users listening habits and unintentionally created extra security vulnerabilities.  55  Detection  edit  Antivirus software typically uses two techniques to detect malware i static analysis and ii dynamicheuristic analysis.  60  Static analysis involves studying the software code of a potentially malicious program and producing a signature of that program. This information is then used to compare scanned files by an antivirus program. Because this approach is not useful for malware that has not yet been studied antivirus software can use dynamic analysis to monitor how the program runs on a computer and block it if it performs unexpected activity. The aim of any malware is to conceal itself from detection by users or antivirus software.  1  Detecting potential malware is difficult for two reasons. The first is that it is difficult to determine if software is malicious.  32  The second is that malware uses technical measures to make it more difficult to detect it.  60  An estimated 33 of malware is not detected by antivirus software.  57  The most commonly employed antidetection technique involves encrypting the malware payload in order to prevent antivirus software from recognizing the signature.  32  Tools such as crypters come with an encrypted blob of malicious code and a decryption stub. The stub decrypts the blob and loads it into memory. Because antivirus does not typically scan memory and only scans files on the drive this allows the malware to evade detection. Advanced malware has the ability to transform itself into different variations making it less likely to be detected due to the differences in its signatures. This is known as polymorphic malware. Other common techniques used to evade detection include from common to uncommon  61  1 evasion of analysis and detection by fingerprinting the environment when executed  62  2 confusing automated tools detection methods. This allows malware to avoid detection by technologies such as signaturebased antivirus software by changing the server used by the malware  61  3 timingbased evasion. This is when malware runs at certain times or following certain actions taken by the user so it executes during certain vulnerable periods such as during the boot process while remaining dormant the rest of the time 4 obfuscating internal data so that automated tools do not detect the malware  63  v information hiding techniques namely stegomalware   64  and 5 fileless malware which runs within memory instead of using files and utilizes existing system tools to carry out malicious acts. The use of existing binaries to carry out malicious activities is a technique known as LotL or Living off the Land.  65  This reduces the amount of forensic artifacts available to analyze. Recently these types of attacks have become more frequent with a 432 increase in 2017 and makeup 35 of the attacks in 2018. Such attacks are not easy to perform but are becoming more prevalent with the help of exploitkits.  66   67  Risks  edit  Vulnerable software  edit  A vulnerability is a weakness flaw or software bug in an application  a complete computer an operating system  or a computer network that is exploited by malware to bypass defences or gain privileges it requires to run. For example TestDisk 6.4 or earlier contained a vulnerability that allowed attackers to inject code into Windows.  68  Malware can exploit security defects  security bugs or vulnerabilities  in the operating system applications such as browsers e.g. older versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer supported by Windows XP  69   or in vulnerable versions of browser plugins such as Adobe Flash Player  Adobe Acrobat or Reader  or Java SE .  70   71  For example a common method is exploitation of a buffer overrun vulnerability where software designed to store data in a specified region of memory does not prevent more data than the buffer can accommodate from being supplied. Malware may provide data that overflows the buffer with malicious executable code or data after the end when this payload is accessed it does what the attacker not the legitimate software determines. Malware can exploit recently discovered vulnerabilities before developers have had time to release a suitable patch .  6  Even when new patches addressing the vulnerability have been released they may not necessarily be installed immediately allowing malware to take advantage of systems lacking patches. Sometimes even applying patches or installing new versions does not automatically uninstall the old versions. There are several ways the users can stay informed and protected from security vulnerabilities in software.
Software providers often announce updates that address security issues.  72  Common vulnerabilities are assigned unique identifiers CVE IDs and listed in public databases like the National Vulnerability Database .
Tools like Secunia PSI  73  free for personal use can scan a computer for outdated software with known vulnerabilities and attempt to update them. Firewalls and intrusion prevention systems can monitor the network traffic for suspicious activity that might indicate an attack.  74  Excessive privileges  edit  Users and programs can be assigned more privileges than they require and malware can take advantage of this. For example of 940 Android apps sampled one third of them asked for more privileges than they required.  75  Apps targeting the Android platform can be a major source of malware infection but one solution is to use thirdparty software to detect apps that have been assigned excessive privileges.  76  Some systems allow all users to make changes to the core components or settings of the system which is considered overprivileged access today. This was the standard operating procedure for early microcomputer and home computer systems where there was no distinction between an administrator or root  and a regular user of the system. In some systems nonadministrator users are overprivileged by design in the sense that they are allowed to modify internal structures of the system. In some environments users are overprivileged because they have been inappropriately granted administrator or equivalent status.  77  This can be because users tend to demand more privileges than they need so often end up being assigned unnecessary privileges.  78  Some systems allow code executed by a user to access all rights of that user which is known as overprivileged code. This was also standard operating procedure for early microcomputer and home computer systems. Malware running as overprivileged code can use this privilege to subvert the system. Almost all currently popular operating systems and also many scripting applications allow code too many privileges usually in the sense that when a user executes code the system allows that code all rights of that user.  citation needed  Weak passwords  edit  A credential attack occurs when a user account with administrative privileges is cracked and that account is used to provide malware with appropriate privileges.  79  Typically the attack succeeds because the weakest form of account security is used which is typically a short password that can be cracked using a dictionary or brute force attack. Using strong passwords and enabling twofactor authentication can reduce this risk. With the latter enabled even if an attacker can crack the password they cannot use the account without also having the token possessed by the legitimate user of that account. Use of the same operating system  edit  Homogeneity can be a vulnerability. For example when all computers in a network run the same operating system upon exploiting one one worm can exploit them all  80  In particular Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X have such a large share of the market that an exploited vulnerability concentrating on either operating system could subvert a large number of systems. It is estimated that approximately 83 of malware infections between January and March 2020 were spread via systems running Windows 10 .  81  This risk is mitigated by segmenting the networks into different subnetworks and setting up firewalls to block traffic between them.  82   83  Mitigation  edit  Antivirus  Antimalware software  edit  Antimalware sometimes also called antivirus  programs block and remove some or all types of malware. For example Microsoft Security Essentials for Windows XP Vista and Windows 7 and Windows Defender for Windows 8  10 and 11  provide realtime protection. The Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool removes malicious software from the system.  84  Additionally several capable antivirus software programs are available for free download from the Internet usually restricted to noncommercial use.  85  Tests found some free programs to be competitive with commercial ones.  85   86   87  Typically antivirus software can combat malware in the following ways Realtime protection They can provide real time protection against the installation of malware software on a computer. This type of malware protection works the same way as that of antivirus protection in that the antimalware software scans all incoming network data for malware and blocks any threats it comes across. Removal Antimalware software programs can be used solely for detection and removal of malware software that has already been installed onto a computer. This type of antimalware software scans the contents of the Windows registry operating system files and installed programs on a computer and will provide a list of any threats found allowing the user to choose which files to delete or keep or to compare this list to a list of known malware components removing files that match.  88   failed verification  Sandboxing Sandboxing confines applications within a controlled environment restricting their operations and isolating them from other applications on the host while limiting access to system resources .  89  Browser sandboxing isolates web processes to prevent malware and exploits enhancing security.  90  Realtime protection  edit  A specific component of antimalware software commonly referred to as an onaccess or realtime scanner hooks deep into the operating systems core or kernel and functions in a manner similar to how certain malware itself would attempt to operate though with the users informed permission for protecting the system. Any time the operating system accesses a file the onaccess scanner checks if the file is infected or not. Typically when an infected file is found execution is stopped and the file is quarantined to prevent further damage with the intention to prevent irreversible system damage. Most AVs allow users to override this behaviour. This can have a considerable performance impact on the operating system though the degree of impact is dependent on how many pages it creates in virtual memory .  91  Sandboxing  edit  Sandboxing is a security model that confines applications within a controlled environment restricting their operations to authorized safe actions and isolating them from other applications on the host. It also limits access to system resources like memory and the file system to maintain isolation.  89  Browser sandboxing is a security measure that isolates web browser processes and tabs from the operating system to prevent malicious code from exploiting vulnerabilities.
It helps protect against malware zeroday exploits  and unintentional data leaks by trapping potentially harmful code within the sandbox.
It involves creating separate processes limiting access to system resources running web content in isolated processes monitoring system calls and memory constraints. Interprocess communication IPC is used for secure communication between processes.
Escaping the sandbox involves targeting vulnerabilities in the sandbox mechanism or the operating systems sandboxing features.  90   92  While sandboxing is not foolproof it significantly reduces the attack surface of common threats.
Keeping browsers and operating systems updated is crucial to mitigate vulnerabilities.  90   92  Website security scans  edit  Website vulnerability scans check the website detect malware may note outdated software and may report known security issues in order to reduce the risk of the site being compromised. Network Segregation  edit  Structuring a network as a set of smaller networks and limiting the flow of traffic between them to that known to be legitimate can hinder the ability of infectious malware to replicate itself across the wider network. Softwaredefined networking provides techniques to implement such controls. Air gap isolation or parallel network  edit  As a last resort computers can be protected from malware and the risk of infected computers disseminating trusted information can be greatly reduced by imposing an air gap i.e. completely disconnecting them from all other networks and applying enhanced controls over the entry and exit of software and data from the outside world. However malware can still cross the air gap in some situations not least due to the need to introduce software into the airgapped network and can damage the availability or integrity of assets thereon. Stuxnet is an example of malware that is introduced to the target environment via a USB drive causing damage to processes supported on the environment without the need to exfiltrate data. AirHopper  93  BitWhisper  94  GSMem  95  and Fansmitter  96  are four techniques introduced by researchers that can leak data from airgapped computers using electromagnetic thermal and acoustic emissions. Research  edit  Utilizing bibliometric analysis the study of malware research trends from 2005 to 2015 considering criteria such as impact journals highly cited articles research areas number of publications keyword frequency institutions and authors revealed an annual growth rate of 34.1. North America led in research output followed by Asia and Europe . China and India were identified as emerging contributors.  97  See also  edit  Botnet Browser hijacking Comparison of antivirus software Computer security Cryptojacking Cryptovirology Cuckoos egg metaphor Cybercrime Cyber spying Domain generation algorithm Facebook malware File binder Identity theft Industrial espionage Linux malware Malvertising Phishing Pointofsale malware Hacktivism Riskware Security in Web apps Social engineering security Targeted threat Technical support scam Telemetry software Typosquatting Web server overload causes Webattacker Zombie computer science References  edit   a b c d e Tahir R. 2018.
