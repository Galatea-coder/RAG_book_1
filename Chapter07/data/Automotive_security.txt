Branch of computer security related to the automotive context Automotive security refers to the branch of computer security focused on the cyber risks related to the automotive context. The increasingly high number of ECUs in vehicles and alongside the implementation of multiple different means of communication from and towards the vehicle in a remote and wireless manner led to the necessity of a branch of cybersecurity dedicated to the threats associated with vehicles. Not to be confused with automotive safety . Causes  edit  The implementation of multiple ECUs Electronic Control Units inside vehicles began in the early 70s thanks to the development of integrated circuits and microprocessors that made it economically feasible to produce the ECUs on a large scale.  1  Since then the number of ECUs has increased to up to 100 per vehicle. These units nowadays control almost everything in the vehicle from simple tasks such as activating the wipers to more safetyrelated ones like brakebywire or ABS Antilock Braking System. Autonomous driving is also strongly reliant on the implementation of new complex ECUs such as the ADAS  alongside sensors  lidars and radars  and their control units. Inside the vehicle the ECUs are connected with each other through cabled or wireless communication networks such as CAN bus controller area network MOST bus Media Oriented System Transport FlexRay Automotive Network Communications Protocol or RF radio frequency as in many implementations of TPMSs tirepressure monitoring systems. Many of these ECUs require data received through these networks that arrive from various sensors to operate and use such data to modify the behavior of the vehicle e.g. the cruise control modifies the vehicles speed depending on signals arriving from a button usually located on the steering wheel. Since the development of cheap wireless communication technologies such as Bluetooth  LTE  WiFi  RFID and similar automotive producers and OEMs have designed ECUs that implement such technologies with the goal of improving the experience of the driver and passengers. Safetyrelated systems such as the OnStar  2  from General Motors  telematic units communication between smartphones and the vehicles speakers through Bluetooth Android Auto  3  and Apple CarPlay .  4  Threat model  edit  Threat models of the automotive world are based on both realworld and theoretically possible attacks. Most realworld attacks aim at the safety of the people in and around the car by modifying the cyberphysical capabilities of the vehicle e.g. steering braking accelerating without requiring actions from the driver  5   6   while theoretical attacks have been supposed to focus also on privacyrelated goals such as obtaining GPS data on the vehicle or capturing microphone signals and similar.  7  Regarding the attack surfaces of the vehicle they are usually divided in longrange shortrange and local attack surfaces  8  LTE and DSRC can be considered longrange ones while Bluetooth and WiFi are usually considered shortrange although still wireless. Finally USB  OBDII and all the attack surfaces that require physical access to the car are defined as local. An attacker that is able to implement the attack through a longrange surface is considered stronger and more dangerous than the one that requires physical access to the vehicle. In 2015 the possibility of attacks on vehicles already on the market has been proven possible by Miller and Valasek that managed to disrupt the driving of a Jeep Cherokee while remotely connecting to it through remote wireless communication.  9   10  Controller area network attacks  edit  The most common network used in vehicles and the one that is mainly used for safetyrelated communication is CAN  due to its realtime properties simplicity and cheapness. For this reason the majority of realworld attacks have been implemented against ECUs connected through this type of network.  5   6   9   10  The majority of attacks demonstrated either against actual vehicles or in testbeds fall in one or more of the following categories Sniffing  edit  Sniffing in the computer security field generally refers to the possibility of intercepting and logging packets or more generally data from a network. In the case of CAN since it is a bus network  every node listens to all communication on the network. 
It is useful for the attacker to read data to learn the behavior of the other nodes of the network before implementing the actual attack. Usually the final goal of the attacker is not to simply sniff the data on CAN since the packets passing on this type of network are not usually valuable just to read.  8  Denial of service  edit  Denial of service  DoS  in information security is usually described as an attack that has the objective of making a machine or a network unavailable. DoS attacks against ECUs connected to CAN buses can be done both against the network by abusing the arbitration protocol used by CAN to always win the arbitration and targeting the single ECU by abusing the error handling protocol of CAN.  11  In this second case the attacker flags the messages of the victim as faulty to convince the victim of being broken and therefore shut itself off the network.  11  Spoofing  edit  Spoofing attacks comprise all cases in which an attacker by falsifying data sends messages pretending to be another node of the network. In automotive security usually spoofing attacks are divided into masquerade and replay attacks . Replay attacks are defined as all those where the attacker pretends to be the victim and sends sniffed data that the victim sent in a previous iteration of authentication. Masquerade attacks are on the contrary spoofing attacks where the data payload has been created by the attacker.  12  Real life automotive threat example  edit  Security researchers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek have successfully demonstrated remote access to a wide variety of vehicle controls using a Jeep Cherokee as the target. They were able to control the radio environmental controls windshield wipers and certain engine and brake functions.  10  The method used to hack the system was implementation of preprogrammed chip into the controller area network CAN bus . By inserting this chip into the CAN bus he was able to send arbitrary message to CAN bus. One other thing that Miller has pointed out is the danger of the CAN bus as it broadcasts the signal which the message can be caught by the hackers throughout the network. The control of the vehicle was all done remotely manipulating the system without any physical interaction. Miller states that he could control any of some 1.4 million vehicles in the United States regardless of the location or distance the only thing needed is for someone to turn on the vehicle to gain access.  13  The work by Miller and Valasek replicated earlier work completed and published by academics in 2010 and 2011 on a different vehicle.  14  The earlier work demonstrated the ability to compromise a vehicle remotely over multiple wireless channels including cellular and the ability to remotely control critical components on the vehicle postcompromise including the telematics unit and the cars brakes. While the earlier academic work was publicly visible both in peerreviewed scholarly publications  15   16  and in the press  17  the Miller and Valesek work received even greater public visibility. Security measures  edit  The increasing complexity of devices and networks in the automotive context requires the application of security measures to limit the capabilities of a potential attacker. Since the early 2000 many different countermeasures have been proposed and in some cases applied. Following a list of the most common security measures  8  Subnetworks  to limit the attacker capabilities even if heshe manages to access the vehicle from remote through a remotely connected ECU the networks of the vehicle are divided in multiple subnetworks and the most critical ECUs are not placed in the same subnetworks of the ECUs that can be accessed from remote.  8  Gateways  the subnetworks are divided by secure gateways or firewalls that block messages from crossing from a subnetwork to the other if they were not intended to.  8  Intrusion Detection Systems IDS  on each critical subnetwork one of the nodes ECUs connected to it has the goal of reading all data passing on the subnetwork and detect messages that given some rules are considered malicious made by an attacker.  18  The arbitrary messages can be caught by the passenger by using IDS which will notify the owner regarding with unexpected message.  19  Authentication protocols  in order to implement authentication on networks where it is not already implemented such as CAN it is possible to design an authentication protocol that works on the higher layers of the ISO OSI model  by using part of the data payload of a message to authenticate the message itself.  12  Hardware Security Modules  since many ECUs are not powerful enough to keep realtime delays while executing encryption or decryption routines between the ECU and the network it is possible to place a hardware security module that manages security for it.  7  Intrusion Detection and ITforensic Measures reactive measures that address basic weaknesses.  20  Legislation  edit  In June 2020 the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe UNECE World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations released two new regulations R155 and R156 establishing clear performance and audit requirements for car manufacturers in terms of automotive cybersecurity and software updates.  21  Notes  edit   Trends in the Semiconductor Industry 1970s .
