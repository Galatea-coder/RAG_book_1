Amateur radio digital communications system Antennas for Highspeed Amateurradio Multimedia Network HamNET in Europe part of the AMPRNet wireless mesh network The AMPRNet AMateur Packet Radio Network or Network 44 is used in amateur radio for packet radio and digital communications between computer networks managed by amateur radio operators . Like other amateur radio frequency allocations  an IP range of 44.0.0.0  8 was provided in 1981 for Amateur Radio Digital Communications a generic term and selfadministered by radio amateurs. In 2001 undocumented and dualuse of 44.0.0.0  8 as a network telescope began  1  recording the spread of the Code Red II worm in July 2001. In mid2019 part of IPv4 range was sold off for conventional use due to IPv4 address exhaustion . Protocol  edit  Beginning on 1 May 1978 the Canadian authorities allowed radio amateurs on the 1.25meter band 220 MHz to use packet radio  and later in 1978 announced the Amateur Digital Radio Operators Certificate.  2   3  Discussion on digital communication amateur radio modes  using the Internet protocol suite  4  and 44  8 IPv4 addresses followed subsequently. By 1988 one thousand assignments of address space had been made.  5  As of December 2009 update approximately 1 of inbound traffic volume to the 448 network was legitimate radio amateur traffic that could be routed onwards with the remaining 2100 gigabyte per day of Internet background noise being diverted and logged by the University of California San Diego UCSD internet telescope for research purposes.  1  By 2016 the Europeanbased Highspeed Amateurradio Multimedia NETwork HAMNET offered a multimegabit Internet Protocol network with 4000 nodes covering central Europe.  6  History and design  edit  The use of the Internet protocols TCPIP on amateur ham radio occurred early in Internet history  preceding the public Internet by over a decade. In 1981 Hank Magnuski obtained the class A 44  8 netblock of 16.7 million IP addresses for amateur radio users worldwide.  7   8  This was prior to Internet flag day 1 January 1983 when the ARPANET Network Control Protocol NCP was replaced by the Transmission Control Protocol TCP.  8  The initial name used by Jon Postel in RFC 790 was the Amateur Radio Experiment Net.  7  Originally the amateur link layer protocol AX.25 carried several competing higher level protocols with TCPIP a minority due to the complexity of the configuration and the high protocol overhead . Very few systems operated over HF for this reason. One approach for 12009600baud VHFUHF operation emerged as TCPIP over ROSE Radio Amateur Telecommunications Society RATS Open Systems Environment based on X.25 CCITT standard. Within just a few years the public Internet made these solutions obsolete. The ROSE system today is maintained by the Open Source FPAC Linux project.  9  The AMPRNet is connected by wireless links and Internet tunnels. Due to the bandwidth limitations of the radio spectrum  300 bits is normally used on HF while VHF and UHF links are usually 1200 bits to 9600 bits. Massproduced WiFi access points equipment on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz is now being used on nearby amateur frequencies to provide much faster links as HSMM or hinternet . Since it is based on IP the AMPRNet supports the same transport and application protocols as the rest of the Internet though there are regulatory restrictions on encryption and thirdparty traffic. The AMPRNet is composed of a series of subnets throughout the world. Portions of the network have pointtopoint radio links to adjacent nodes while others are completely isolated. Geographically dispersed radio subnets can be connected using an IP tunnel between sites with Internet connectivity. Many of these sites also have a tunnel to a central router which routes between the 44 network and the rest of the Internet using static routing tables updated by volunteers. As of October 2011 update experimentation had moved beyond these centrally controlled static solutions to dynamic configurations provided by Peer to Peer VPN systems such as n2n  and ZeroTier . Address administration  edit  The allocation plan agreed in late1986 reserved half of the address space  44.0  9 or 8 million addresses for use within United States territory and  44.128  9  the remaining 8 million addresses for the rest of the world.  10  After the sale of 44.192.0.0  10 in 2019 the remaining Internet protocol IP addresses are the 44.0.0.0  9 for USA subnets and 44.128.0.0  10 subnet for the rest of the world available to any licensed amateur radio operator.  11  The IP address management and assigning of addresses is done by volunteer coordinators with the proviso we do not provide the same level of response as a commercial organisation. These addresses can possibly be made routable over the Internet if fully coordinated with the volunteer administrators. Radio amateurs wanting to request IP addresses within the AMPRNet should visit the AMPRNet Portal.  12  mirrorshades router  edit  San Diego Supercomputer Center  host of AMPRNet internet gateway  and CAIDAUCSD network telescope Since the 1990s most packets within the 44  8 range were arranged to transit via an IP tunnel using IP in IP encapsulation tofrom a router hosted at the University of California San Diego .  13  This forwarding router was originally named mirrorshades.ucsd.edu  13  and later gw.ampr.org  14  or  AmprGW .  11   14   15   16  By 1996 higherspeed 56k modems briefly had greater throughput than was possible to forward via the mirrorshades central reflector router and back again.  17  Only IP addresses with an active Domain Name System DNS entry under ampr.org are passed by the packet filter for forwarding.  11   18  By 19 August 1999 daily encapsulated IP in IP traffic was 100 kilobits per second  peaking to 0.14 megabits per second .  19  During mid2000 the majority of unique IP addresses seen on the University of California San Diego connection from CERFnet began with the 44 prefix except for 17 of IP addresses which did not.  20  In mid2009 the mirrorshades server was upgraded and replaced after about 1100 days uptime .  21  A funding proposal in 2010 raised the possibility that The legitimate traffic is also a potential research resource.  1  UCSD Network Telescope  edit  Beginning in February 2001  1   22   23   24  as part of backscatter research and the CAIDAUCSD network telescope project the whole of the 44  8 address block  25  was being advertised via the border gateway protocol BGP as a passive honeypot for Internet background noise and backscatter collection  24   26  based in the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis  note 1  at the San Diego Supercomputer Center .  29  On 15 July 2001 the network monitoring of 44.0.0.0  8 traffic recorded the spread of the Code Red II worm.  30  Prior to July 2001 the project had been logging unsolicited TCP SYN packets destined for IP addresses within 44.0.0.0  8  and after 19 July 2001 full incoming IP header logging took place.  31  The 44  8 IP address block was stated to have high value to research.  32  Capture data for August 2001 using data compression and retaining only IP headers was 0.5 gigabyte per hour.  33  In 2002 the block was 0.4 of all internet IPv4 address space.  34  By September 2003 traffic was 0.75 terabytes per month and costing 2500 per month for bandwidth.  35  In October 2004 Limelight Networks began to sponsor the internet transit costs of the CAIDA network telescope.  35  In April 2009 the upstream rate limiting was removed increasing the number of packets reaching the network telescope.  36  At the end of 2012 seaport.caida.org was the network telescope data capture server with thor.caida.org used for near realtime data access.  25   37   38  As of 2016 update  the 448 network was receiving backscatter from DenialofService attacks DoS each measuring 226 packets per second  mean peak average  39  totalling 37 terabytes per month.  38  Support was supplied by Cisco Systems under a University Research Board URB grant.  31   40  The project was funded by an Advanced Networking Infrastructure and Research ANIR award  41  and Computer and Network Systems CNS award  42  from the National Science Foundation NSF the United States Department of Homeland Security DHS  41  and Network Modeling  Simulation NMS  Next Generation Internet Program NGI of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA.  26   31   Both Cooperative Association for Internet Data Analysis CAIDA and Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis CAIDA appear in academic texts.  27   28  Feed  edit  In May 2017 the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis provided a new server for the AMPRNet gateway in a different building.  16  As of mid2017 a passive monitoring configuration was in use involving a network switch with port mirroring set to duplicate the incoming packets being seen by the AMPRNet gateway to the UCSD network telescope capture server.  24  The project funding proposal for Sustainable Tools for Analysis and Research on Darknet Unsolicited Traffic STARDUST specified a planned upgrading to 10 Gigabit Ethernet with a passive optical tap  in order to provide finer timestamping and avoid packet loss .  24  By July 2018 the replacement 10 Gigabit Ethernet infrastructure using an optical splitter and Endace capture card was operational.  43  Archives  edit  The archived intermittent captures for 20012008 were 657 gigabytes .  44  The archived pcap captures from 20082012 were 192 terabytes of data uncompressed.  45  In January 2012 five weeks of recent data were 5.5 terabytes uncompressed.  45  Beginning on 22 March 2012 the raw hourly compressed pcap traces from 20032012 were transferred to the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center NERSC for longterm storage and research data archiving .  36  This data migration of 104.66 tebibytes took one week at a sustained rate of 1.5 gigabits per second via the Energy Sciences Network ESnet.  36  For the 20122017 period 2.85 petabytes of data was collected 1.3 petabyte compressed.  25  As of 31 December 2017 update  the overall total collected by the UCSD Network Telescope stood at 3.25 petabytes uncompressed stored across 129552 hourly files.  25  Users of the collected data up to 2012 are requested to acknowledge that Support for Backscatter Datasets and the UCSD Network Telescope is provided by Cisco Systems  Limelight Networks  the US Department of Homeland Security  the National Science Foundation  DARPA  Digital Envoy  and CAIDA Members.  46  Block size  edit  The original Class A network allocation for amateur radio was made in the 1970s  47  and recorded in September 1981  7  which consisted of 16 million IP addresses. As of 18 July 2019 the lower 75 of the 44  8 block 12 million addresses remained for amateur radio usage with the upper 25  44.192  10  4 million IP address having been sold.  48   49  Owing to IPv4 address exhaustion  by 2016 the 44  8 block was worth over  100 million .  8  The 44  8 routing prefix aggregation stopped being advertised on 4 June 2019.  50  John Curran  CEO of the American Registry for Internet Numbers registry stated that a request for the transfer of IP addresses had been received and reviewed in accordance with ARIN policy.  51  On 18 July 2019 the designation recorded by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority was altered from  044  8 Amateur Radio Digital Communications  52  to  044  8 Administered by ARIN .  53  On 18 July 2019 there was a sale of 44.192.0.0  10 address space to Amazon Technologies Inc which was the highest bidder  49  for use by Amazon Web Services .  54  AMPRNet subsequently consisted of 44.0  9  and 44.128  10   55  with no plans to sell any more address space.  56  The aspiration expressed by those involved in the sale was that money be held by a nonprofit 501c3 organization for the advancement of amateur radio.  57  The sale raised over 50 million.  56  Prior to sale addresses in the 44.192  10 block had been allocated to amateur radio areas for the outer space  amateur radio satellite service  58   59   60  to roaming   60  Oceania   58   59   60  Antarctica   58   59   60  the Arctic   58   59   60  Italy for Centro Italiano Sperimentazione ed Attività Radiantistiche CisarNet  61   62  Germany for Stuttgart  Tübingen   63  Eppstein   63  plus the GermanypanEuropean Highspeed Amateurradio Multimedia NETwork  de  HAMNET.  62   64   65  Responses  edit  Paul Vixie stated after the sale of IP address space that ampr.org can make better use of money than IP space in fulfilling its nonprofit mission at this stage of the game .  66  Doug Barton a former manager of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority  said the reaction that were seeing now is 100 predictable ... that doesnt change anything about my opinion that the sale itself was totally reasonable done by reasonable people and in keeping with the concept of being good stewards of the space .  67  Governance  edit  Initial committee  edit  An Amateur Radio Digital Communications committee was formed to offer advice on digital standards to the American Radio Relay League ARRL board of directors following a meeting in 1981. The original working name was the ARRL Ad Hoc Committee on Digital Communication abbreviated to digital committee.  68  During the mid1980s the committee had been meeting twice per year during the middle of the year and again at the annual Computer Networking conference.  69  In September 1987 the committee recommended the list of frequencies that would be used in North America for packet radio and digital communications.  70  In January 1988 the committee held a meeting to standardise AX.25 version 3.  71  In March 1988 the Packet Radio Frequency Recommendations were published by the committee.  72  During early 1993 the committee and ARRL board of directors were working on guidelines for semiautomatic digital stations with the proposals passed to the Federal Communications Commission .  73  Nonprofit transition  edit  Amateur Radio Digital Communications Inc.
