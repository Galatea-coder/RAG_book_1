American research and development company Raytheon BBN Company type Subsidiary Founded 1948  77 years ago  1948  Founder Leo Beranek and Richard Bolt Headquarters Cambridge Massachusetts  United States Parent RTX Corporation Website www .rtx .com whoweare wearertx transformativetechnologies bbn Raytheon BBN originally Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc.  is an American research and development company based in Cambridge Massachusetts  United States .  1  In 1966 the Franklin Institute awarded the firm the Frank P. Brown Medal  in 1999 BBN received the IEEE Corporate Innovation Recognition  and on 1 February 2013 BBN was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation  the highest honors that the U.S. government bestows upon scientists engineers and inventors by President Barack Obama .  2  It became a wholly owned subsidiary of Raytheon in 2009. History  edit  1960s logo of Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. BBN has its roots in an initial partnership formed on 15 October 1948 between Leo Beranek and Richard Bolt  professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .  3   4  Bolt had won a commission to be an acoustic consultant for the new United Nations permanent headquarters to be built in New York City. Realizing the magnitude of the project at hand Bolt had pulled in his MIT colleague Beranek for help and the partnership between the two was born. The firm Bolt and Beranek started out in two rented rooms on the MIT campus. Robert Newman joined the firm soon after in 1950 and the firm became Bolt Beranek Newman.  5  Beranek remained the companys president and chief executive officer until 1967 and Bolt was chairman until 1976. From 1957 to 1962 J. C. R. Licklider served as vice president of engineering psychology for BBN.  6  Foreseeing the potential to obtain federal grants for basic computer research Licklider convinced the BBN leadership to purchase a then stateoftheart Royal McBee LGP30 digital computer in 1958 for US25000. Within a year Ken Olsen  president of the newly formed Digital Equipment Corporation DEC approached BBN to test the prototype of DECs first computer the PDP1 .  7  Within one month BBN completed its tests and recommendations of the PDP1. BBN ultimately purchased the first PDP1 for around US150000 and received the machine in November 1960.  8   9  After the PDP1 arrived BBN hired two of Lickliders friends from MIT John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky  as consultants.  10  McCarthy had been unsuccessful in convincing MIT engineers to build timesharing systems for computers. He had more success at BBN though working with Ed Fredkin and Sheldon Boilen in implementing one of the first timesharing systems the BBN TimeSharing System .  11  In 1962 BBN would install one such timeshared information system at Massachusetts General Hospital where doctors and nurses could create and access patients information at various nurses stations connected to a central computer.  5  BBN would soon begin more research about integrating computers and medicine hiring Bob Taylor in 1965 and MIT Lincoln Laboratory computer systems engineer Frank Heart in 1966.  12  As BBN began focusing on computer technology it gained a reputation as the third university in Cambridge alongside Harvard and MIT  and its offices expanded on a site near Fresh Pond in western Cambridge.  13  By 1968 the company had over 600 employees.  14  By the early 1970s BBN bought a laundromat on Moulton Street and tore it down for a new sevenstory headquarters.  15  In 1980 the U.S. federal government charged BBN with contracts fraud alleging that from 1972 to 1978 BBN altered time sheets to hide overcharging the government. That year two top financial officers plea bargained for suspended sentences and US20000 fines and the company paid a US700000 fine.  16  BBNs September 1994 celebration of the 25th anniversary of ARPANET generated much local and national news coverage from outlets including The Boston Globe  Newsweek  and National Public Radio .  17  By that year Heart retired from BBN after 28 years his final position was president of the systems and technology division.  18  Notable achievements  edit  Dilution refrigerator at BBN Technologies used to create superconducting quantum computing devices Dr. Talib Hussain senior scientist at BBN Technologies looks over the shoulder of a recruit during a training session on the Virtual Environments for Ship and Shore Experiential Learning system at Recruit Training Command. BBN is best known for its DARPA sponsored research. It has made notable advances in a wide variety of fields including acoustics  computer technologies quantum information  and synthetic biology . In recent years BBN has led a wide range of research and development projects including the standardization effort for the security extension to the Border Gateway Protocol  BGPsec  mobile ad hoc networks  advanced speech recognition  the militarys Boomerang mobile shooter detection system cognitive radio spectrum use via the DARPA XG program. In the early 2000s BBN created the worlds first quantum key distribution network the DARPA Quantum Network  which operated for 3 years across Cambridge and Boston and which included the worlds first fully operational prototype of a superconducting nanowire singlephoton detector . BBN also led the Global Environment for Network Innovations GENI project for the National Science Foundation  which ultimately built out programmable future Internet infrastructure across approximately 60 university campuses.  19  Interface Message Processor  edit  In August 1968 BBN was selected by ARPA to build the Interface Message Processors IMPs for the ARPANET  the precursor to the modern Internet.  20   nb 1  The IMPs were the very first generation of gateways  known today as routers . Under the leadership of Frank Heart and Bob Kahn  four IMPs were produced for nearly US1 million from September to December 1969.  21   22  The first IMP was shipped to the University of California Los Angeles in September 1969 and the second to the Stanford Research Institute a month later.  23  The first message between the two IMPs was LO  phonetically Hello  but the SRI host crashed before the UCLA researcher could complete typing the LOGIN command.  5   24  Acoustics  edit  Wellknown acoustics commissions include MITs Kresge Auditorium 1954 Tanglewood s Koussevitzky Music Shed 1959 Lincoln Center s Avery Fisher Hall 1962 Clowes Memorial Hall 1963 in Indianapolis the National Gallery of Victoria 1968 the Cultural Center of the Philippines 1969 Baltimores Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall 1978  citation needed  and Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall 1979. The architectural acoustics division of BBN faced controversy in the early 1960s with its acoustics design project for the Philharmonic Hall now David Geffen Hall  at the Lincoln Center in New York City. Beranek and BBNs chief architect were criticized for ignoring important acoustical principles in concert hall design. Many failed minor adjustments led the walls balconies and ceilings to be torn out and dumped and a new consultant oversaw a repair that cost millions of dollars over several years.  13  The division also produced poor results at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco . The halls large volume and seating capacity initially resulted in less than ideal results. Kirkegaard Associates completed acoustical renovations in 1992 at a cost of US10 million which resulted in substantial improvement.  25  In the 1960s and 1970s experts at the company examined audio tapes related to notable events in U.S. history including the John F. Kennedy assassination Dictabelt recording   26  an audio recording from the 1970 Kent State shootings  and during the 1974 Watergate scandal  the tape of President Richard Nixon that had 18.5 minutes erased.  27  The substantial calculations required for acoustics work led to an interest and later business opportunities in computing. BBN was a pioneer in developing computer models of roadway and aircraft noise  and in designing noise barriers near highways.  28  Some of this technology was used in landmark legal cases where BBN scientists were expert witnesses.  29  In early 2004 BBN applied its acoustics expertise to design develop and deliver the Boomerang shooter detection system in a little over two months to combat the sniper threat US troops faced in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The system immediately pinpoints the location of hostile fire. Since then more than 11000 Boomerang systems have been deployed by U.S. and allied forces. Computer technologies  edit  BBN bought a number of computers in the late 1950s and early 1960s notably the first production PDP1 from Digital Equipment Corporation  on which it implemented the BBN TimeSharing System 1962.  9  Ray Tomlinson of BBN is widely credited as having invented the first persontoperson network email in 1971  30  and the use of the  sign in an email address.  31   32   33  BBN has had a very distinguished career in naturallanguage understanding   34   35  ranging from speech recognition through machine translation and more recently machine understanding of the causality of events and accurate forecasts for the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity IARPA.  36  BBNs education group led by Wally Feurzeig  created the Logo programming language  conceived by BBN consultant Seymour Papert as a programming language that schoolage children could learn.  37  Other wellknown BBN computerrelated innovations include Interlisp programming language the TENEX operating system  and the Colossal Cave Adventure game. BBN also is well known for its parallel computing systems including the Pluribus  and the BBN Butterfly computers which have been used for such tasks as warfare simulation for the U.S. Navy .  38  BBN also developed the RS1 RSExplore RSDiscover and the Cornerstone statistical software systems and played a pioneering role in the development of todays semantic web  including participating in the DARPA Agent Markup Language project and chairing Web Ontology Language standardization. Networking technologies  edit  The Internet circa 1985. BBN built and operated the MILNET  ARPANET  SATNET  and Wideband networks BBN was involved in building some of the earliest computer networks  including the implementation and operation of the ARPANET  39   33 and its Interface Message Processors   40   nb 1   as well as SATNET  PRNET  MILNET  SIMNET  the Terrestrial Wideband Network  the Defense Simulation Internet  CSNET  and NEARNET . In the course of these activities BBN researchers invented the first linkstate routing protocol . BBN was a key participant in the creation of the Internet . It was the first organization to receive an Autonomous System Number AS1 for network identification.  42  ASNs are an essential identification element used for Internet Backbone Routing lower numbers generally indicate a longer established presence on the Internet. AS1 is now operated by Level 3 Communications following their acquisition of BBNs Genuity internet service provider . BBN registered the bbn.com domain on 24 April 1985 making it the second oldest domain name on the internet.  43   44  In addition BBN researchers participated in the development of TCP  created the Voice Funnel  an early predecessor of voice over IP  helped lead the creation of the first email security standard Privacy Enhanced Mail PEM chaired development of the core Internet Protocol security suite  IPsec  standards and performed extensive work to secure the Border Gateway Protocol BGP. BBN also created a series of mobile ad hoc networks starting in the 1970s with DARPAs experimental PRNET and SURAN systems. Later BBN efforts included the networking portions of the Nearterm digital radio NTDR and Highcapacity data radio HCDR the Wideband Networking Software in the Joint Tactical Radio System and the Wireless Network after Next WNaN. It also created the networking portions of the U.S. Armys Mobile Subscriber Equipment MSE and Canadas Iris Digital Communications System .

Former BBNer Dedre Gentner is Alice Gabrielle Twight Professor of Psychology at Northwestern University. Former board members include Jim Breyer  Anita K. Jones and Gilman Louie . Spinoffs and mergers  edit  In 1971 BBNs TELCOMP subsidiary was sold. In the 1970s BBN created Telenet  Inc. to run the first public packetswitched network. In 1983 BBN Instruments was sold to VibroMeter Corp.. In 1989 BBNs acoustical consulting business was spun off into a new corporation Acentech Incorporated located across the street from BBN headquarters in Cambridge.  46  In 1994 LightStream Corp. a joint venture with UngermannBass  Inc. created in 1992 to manufacture asynchronous transfer mode ATM switches was sold to Cisco Systems Inc. for US120 million. BBN formed an early Internet service provider in 1994 as its BBN Planet division.  47  Previously traded as BBN on the stock market the company was purchased by GTE in 1997 as a wholly owned subsidiary.  48  BBN Planet was joined with GTEs national fiber network to become GTE Internetworking powered by BBN. When GTE and Bell Atlantic merged to become Verizon in 2000 the Internet service provider division of BBN was included in assets spun off as Genuity to satisfy Federal Communications Commission FCC requirements leaving behind the remainder of BBN Technologies. Genuity was later acquired out of bankruptcy by Level 3 Communications in 2003.  49  In March 2004 Verizon sold the remainder of the company by then known as BBNT Solutions LLC to a group of private investors from Accel Partners  General Catalyst Partners InQTel and BBNs own management  50  making BBN an independent company for the next five years. In September 2009 Raytheon entered into an agreement to acquire BBN as a wholly owned subsidiary.  51  The acquisition was completed on 29 October 2009  52  and the company was valued at approximately US350 million.  53  BBN owned the domain bbn.com the second oldest currently registered domain name on the Internet which ran continuously from April 1985 to midDecember 2019. Digital Force Technologies DFT of San Diego California was a wholly owned BBN subsidiary purchased in June 2008 and spun out in 2018.  54  Former BBN employees have formed about a hundred startup companies including Parlance Corporation and EveryZing .  55   56  Locations and subsidiaries  edit  As of 2013 Raytheon BBN maintains offices in  57  Cambridge Highlands  Cambridge Massachusetts Columbia Maryland St. Louis Park Minnesota OFallon Illinois Newport East  Middletown Rhode Island near Naval Station Newport  58  Rosslyn Arlington Virginia near Washington D.C.
