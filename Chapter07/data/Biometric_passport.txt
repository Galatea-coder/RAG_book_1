Passport that has an embedded electronic microprocessor chip Not to be confused with Biological passport or Machinereadable passport . This biometric symbol is usually printed on the cover of biometric ICAO compliant passports. A biometric passport also known as an electronic passport  epassport or a digital passport  is a passport that has an embedded electronic microprocessor chip which contains biometric information that can be used to authenticate the identity of the passport holder. It uses contactless smart card technology including a microprocessor chip computer chip and antenna for both power to the chip and communication embedded in the front or back cover or centre page of the passport. The passports critical information is printed on the data page of the passport repeated on the machine readable lines and stored in the chip. Public key infrastructure PKI is used to authenticate the data stored electronically in the passport chip supposedly making it expensive and difficult to forge when all security mechanisms are fully and correctly implemented. Most countries are issuing biometric passports to their citizens. Malaysia was the first country to issue biometric passports in 1998.  1  By the end of 2008 60 countries were issuing such passports  2  which increased to over 150 by mid2019.  3  The currently standardised biometrics used for this type of identification system are facial recognition  fingerprint recognition  and iris recognition . These were adopted after assessment of several different kinds of biometrics including retinal scan . Document and chip characteristics are documented in the International Civil Aviation Organization s ICAO Doc 9303 ICAO 9303.  4  The ICAO defines the biometric file formats and communication protocols to be used in passports. Only the digital image usually in JPEG or JPEG 2000 format of each biometric feature is actually stored in the chip. The comparison of biometric features is performed outside the passport chip by electronic border control systems eborders. To store biometric data on the contactless chip it includes a minimum of 32 kilobytes of EEPROM storage memory and runs on an interface in accordance with the ISOIEC 14443 international standard amongst others. These standards intend interoperability between different countries and different manufacturers of passport books. Some national identity cards  such as those from Albania  Brazil  the Netherlands  and Saudi Arabia are fully ICAO 9303 compliant biometric travel documents . However others such as the United States passport card  are not.  5  Data protection  edit  This section needs additional citations for verification .

September 2022   Learn how and when to remove this message  Biometric passports have protection mechanisms to avoid andor detect attacks Nontraceable chip characteristics Random chip identifiers reply to each request with a different chip number. This prevents tracing of passport chips. Using random identification numbers is optional. Basic Access Control BAC BAC protects the communication channel between the chip and the reader by encrypting transmitted information. Before data can be read from a chip the reader needs to provide a key which is derived from the Machine Readable Zone  the date of birth the date of expiry and the document number. If BAC is used an attacker cannot easily eavesdrop transferred information without knowing the correct key. Using BAC is optional. Passive Authentication PA PA is aimed at identifying modification of passport chip data. The chip contains a file Document Security Object SOD that stores hash values of all files stored in the chip picture fingerprint etc. and a digital signature of these hashes. The digital signature is made using a document signing key which itself is signed by a country signing key. If a file in the chip e.g. the picture is changed this can be detected since the hash value is incorrect. Readers need access to all used public country keys to check whether the digital signature is generated by a trusted country. Using PA is mandatory.  6  As of January 2017 55 of over 60 epassportissuing countries belong to the PKD program.  7  Active Authentication AA AA prevents cloning of passport chips. The chip contains a private key that cannot be read or copied but its existence can easily be proven. Using AA is optional. Extended Access Control EAC EAC adds functionality to check the authenticity of both the chip chip authentication and the reader terminal authentication. Furthermore it uses stronger encryption than BAC. EAC is typically used to protect fingerprints and iris scans. Using EAC is optional. In the European Union  using EAC is mandatory for all documents issued starting 28 June 2009.  citation needed  Supplemental Access Control SAC SAC was introduced by ICAO in 2009 for addressing BAC weaknesses. It was introduced as a supplement to BAC for keeping compatibility but will replace it in the future. Shielding the chip This prevents unauthorised reading. Some countries  including at least the US  have integrated a very thin metal mesh into the passports cover to act as a shield when the passport cover is closed.  8  The use of shielding is optional. To assure interoperability and functionality of the security mechanisms listed above ICAO and German Federal Office for Information Security BSI have specified several test cases. These test specifications are updated with every new protocol and are covering details starting from the paper used and ending in the chip that is included.  9  Attacks  edit  Since the introduction of biometric passports several attacks have been presented and demonstrated. Nontraceable chip characteristics In 2008 a RadboudLausitz University team demonstrated that it is possible to determine which country a passport chip is from without knowing the key required for reading it.  10  The team fingerprinted error messages of passport chips from different countries. The resulting lookup table allows an attacker to determine from where a chip originated. In 2010 Tom Chothia and Vitaliy Smirnov documented an attack that allows an individual passport to be traced  11   12  by sending specific BAC authentication requests. In 2016 Avoine et al. published a survey on security and privacy issues in passport protocols where a new technique to track passports is introduced based on the response time of basic commands.  13  Basic Access Control BAC In 2005 Marc Witteman showed that the document numbers of Dutch passports were predictable  14  allowing an attacker to guesscrack the key required for reading the chip. In 2006 Adam Laurie wrote software that tries all known passport keys within a given range thus implementing one of Wittemans attacks. Using online flight booking sites flight coupons and other public information its possible to significantly reduce the number of possible keys. In some early biometric passports BAC wasnt used at all allowing attacker to read the chips content without providing a key.  15  Passive Authentication PA In 2006 Lukas Grunwald demonstrated that it is trivial to copy passport data from a passport chip into a standard ISOIEC 14443 smartcard using a standard contactless card interface and a simple file transfer tool.  16  Grunwald used a passport that did not use Active Authentication anticloning and did not change the data held on the copied chip thus keeping its cryptographic signature valid. In 2008 Jeroen van Beek demonstrated that not all passport inspection systems check the cryptographic signature of a passport chip. For his demonstration Van Beek altered chip information and signed it using his own document signing key of a nonexisting country. This can only be detected by checking the country signing keys that are used to sign the document signing keys. To check country signing keys the ICAO PKD  17  can be used. Only 5 out of 60 countries are using this central database.  18  Van Beek did not update the original passport chip instead an ePassport emulator was used.  19  Also in 2008 The Hackers Choice implemented all attacks and published code to verify the results.  20  The release included a video clip that demonstrated problems by using a forged Elvis Presley passport that is recognized as a valid US passport.  21  Active Authentication AA In 2005 Marc Witteman showed that the secret Active Authentication key can be retrieved using power analysis.  14  This may allow an attacker to clone passport chips that use the optional Active Authentication anticloning mechanism on chips  if the chip design is susceptible to this attack. In 2008 Jeroen van Beek demonstrated that optional security mechanisms can be disabled by removing their presence from the passport index file.  22  This allows an attacker to remove  amongst others  anticloning mechanisms Active Authentication. The attack is documented in supplement 7 of Doc 9303 R1p1_v2_sIV_0006  23  and can be solved by patching inspection system software. Note that supplement 7 features vulnerable examples in the same document that  when implemented  result in a vulnerable inspection process.  citation needed  In 2014 Calderoni et al. show a procedure to bypass the security protocol that is commonly adopted to prove chip authenticity Active Authentication within firstgeneration electronic passports. The discussed breach is related to some metadata files EF.COM EF.SOD and allows the attacker to conceal those data required by the inspection system during the protocols execution.  24  This breach may facilitate a malicious user in using fake documents cloned from original ones. Extended Access Control EAC In 2007 Lukas Grunwald presented an attack that can make EACenabled passport chips unusable.  25  Grunwald states that if an EACkey  required for reading fingerprints and updating certificates  is stolen or compromised an attacker can upload a false certificate with an issue date far in the future. The affected chips block read access until the future date is reached. Opposition  edit  Map of countries with biometric passports as of August 2024 Privacy proponents in many countries question and protest the lack of information about exactly what the passports chip will contain and whether they affect civil liberties . The main problem they point out is that data on the passports can be transferred with wireless RFID technology which can become a major vulnerability. Although this could allow ID check computers to obtain a persons information without a physical connection it may also allow anyone with the necessary equipment to perform the same task. If the personal information and passport numbers on the chip are not encrypted  the information might wind up in the wrong hands. On 15 December 2006 the BBC published an article  26  on the British ePassport citing the above stories and adding that Nearly every country issuing this passport has a few security experts who are yelling at the top of their lungs and trying to shout out This is not secure. This is not a good idea to use this technology citing a specialist who states It is much too complicated. It is in places done the wrong way round  reading data first parsing data interpreting data then verifying whether it is right. There are lots of technical flaws in it and there are things that have just been forgotten so it is basically not doing what it is supposed to do. It is supposed to get a higher security level. It is not. and adding that the Future of Identity in the Information Society FIDIS networks research team a body of IT security experts funded by the European Union has also come out against the ePassport scheme... stating that European governments have forced a document on its people that dramatically decreases security and increases the risk of identity theft.  27  Most security measures are designed against untrusted citizens the provers but the scientific security community recently also addressed the threats from untrustworthy verifiers such as corrupt governmental organizations or nations using poorly implemented unsecure electronic systems.  28  New cryptographic solutions such as private biometrics are being proposed to mitigate threats of mass theft of identity. These are under scientific study but not yet implemented in biometric passports.

India  edit  See also Indian passport India calls Biometric Passport as ePassport. The Government of India issues three different types of passports  Diplomatic passports Official passports and regularordinary passports. India initiated the first phase deployment of Biometric Passports in 2008 only to diplomatic passport holders. On 25 June 2008 Indian Passport Authority issued the first Biometric passport to Pratibha Patil  the then President of India .  77  Between 2008 and 2024 Biometric passport rollout for ordinary citizens was in various stages of internal development testing and tendering. In April 2024 The Government has finally started the test rollout of Biometric Passports to ordinary citizens. It started with the testing of the project at Regional Passport Offices RPO in Bhubaneswar and Nagpur. Post successful pilot launch and requisite certifications it will be rolled out at remaining Regional Passport Offices across India in a phased manner in 2025. Indonesia  edit  See also Indonesian passport 48page biometric passports cost Rp650000  US 43.  78  As of 12 October 2022 the validity of newly issued passports are extended from 5 years to 10 years.  79  Diplomatic and service biometric passports are issued since 19 August 2021.  80  Iran  edit  See also Iranian passport Issued since July 2007 for diplomatic and service passports 20 February 2011 for ordinary biometric passports. The cost of a new passport was approximately IRR 1500000 less than US8 if issued inside Iran 100 euros if issued overseas.  81  Iraq  edit  See also Iraqi passport Iraq started issuing the biometric passport to the public in March 2023.  82  Israel  edit  See also Israeli passport Issued since July 2013 for a 2year pilot project under the Biometric Database Law . This was optional. In August 2013 any passport expiring in more than 2 years could be replaced free of charge with a biometric one upon request. Passports expiring within 2 years were charged the full fee. 
The review of the pilot project that was supposed to be concluded in 2015 was postponed by order of the Minister of the Interior to a later date due to the controversy regarding the creation of the Biometric Database rather than storing the biometric data only in the passports chip as is the practice in many other countries. In 2015 the duration of the pilot project was extended until 2017. In May 2017 the pilot project ended. Newly issued passports were then required to be biometric.  83  To obtain a biometric passport an applicant must appear in an Interior Ministry office to be photographed by the special camera which records information such as facial bone structure distance between ones eyes ears to eyes and ratio of facial features one from another. The applicant will also be fingerprinted and all this information will be stored in the new hightech electronic passport.  84  As of January 2022 Israeli passports issued in the airport or outside of Israel are not biometric and are generally valid for 510 years 1 year if issued as an emergency passport in the airport.

Malaysia  edit  See also Malaysian passport Issued since 1998.  1  Malaysia is however not a member of the Visa Waiver Program VWP and its first biometric passport did not conform to the same standards as the VWP biometric document because the Malaysian biometric passport was issued several years ahead of the VWP requirement. The difference lies in the storage of fingerprint template instead of fingerprint image in the chip the rest of the technologies are the same. Also the biometric passport was designed to be read only if the receiving country has the authorisation from the Malaysian Immigration Department . Malaysia started issuing ICAO compliant passports from February 2010.  86  Malaysia used to issue passports with validity for 2 years and 5 years but the passport with 2 years validity was withdrawn since January 2015.  87  The pricing for a Malaysian passport are RM 200 approximately US50 with 5 years validity MYR 100 approximately US25 for senior citizens children below 12 Hajj pilgrims and students below 21 and studying abroad is MYR 100 and is free for disabled citizens.  88  Maldives  edit  See also Maldivian passport Issued since 26 July 2006.
