Large amount of sensitive sensor and userinput data is synced with mobile apps such as fitness mood sleep water intake medicine usage sexual activity menstruation and potential illnesses. This has led to privacy concerns around how consumer information is stored and analyzed by the companies involved.  3  History  edit  Wearable heart rate monitors for athletes were available in 1981.  4  Improvements in technology in the late 20th and early 21st century made it possible to automate the recording of fitness activities as well as to integrate monitors into more easily worn equipment. The RSComputer shoe was released in 1986. Early examples include wristwatchsized bicycle computers that monitored speed duration distance etc. available at least by the early 1990s. By at least the early 2000s wearable fitness tracking devices were available as consumergrade electronics including wireless heart rate monitors that could be connected to commercialgrade exercise machines in gyms. Athletes are usually tracked with the levels of internal and external loads where external loads will consist of the performance outcomes usually witnessed by coaches and internal loads consist of factors such as heart rate blood pressure and blood lactate levels.  5  When taking into account the wellbeing of the subject subjective scales are involved which measure fatigue sleep quality emotions and soreness.  5   non sequitur  Fitness trackers later diversified to include wristbands and armbands socalled smart bands and smaller devices that could be clipped wherever preferred.  6   7  In 2006 Apple and Nike released the NikeiPod  a sensorequipped shoe that worked with an iPod Nano . By 2010 logging apps had been introduced many of which integrated the direct sharing of data to Facebook ot Twitter.  8  Fitness trackers became appealing to consumers because of the combination of gamification  the social dimension of sharing via social media  and increased motivation due to the resulting rivalry and competition between friends.  9  In 2016 there were several advances made regarding fitness tracking geared toward kids with a variety of options from organizations such as UNICEF and Garmin .  10  Tracker formats  edit  Most consumer fitness trackers are worn on a wristband similar to a wristwatch . This type of tracker usually includes a digital display for data.  11  Wristbased trackers may be prone to error during exercise involving rapid arm motion.  12  Some fitness trackers take the form of a ring. Ringbased trackers have no display of their own and rely on a connection with a smartphone to display tracked data.  13  Another lowprofile format for fitness trackers places sensors inside of earphones . These trackers rely on a smartphone to display data similar to ringbased trackers. Earphonebased fitness trackers use sensors to take readings directly from the capillaries located within the ear. Due to their placement these trackers can give more accurate results for blood pressure electrocardiogram  and body temperature.  14  Fitness trackers placed in the ear are also well suited to the assessment of heart rate.  12  Activity tracking on smartwatches  edit  An Apple Watch showing the numbers that track a typical run. A fitbit watch showing conditions for a workout A Garmin watch tracking activity and health data Many devices primarily intended as smartwatches also function as fitness trackers. 
An early example was the Apple Watch  which has offered fitness tracker functions since 2014.  15  Tracker apps  edit  The standard activitytracking smartphone or web apps present data in statistical form meant to be viewed after the activity has ended. However research suggests that if we want a richer understanding of the data we need intelligent computing to be included in the systems that run the apps.  16  Performance problems  edit  Certain movements of the user can distort the results obtained from fitness trackers as seen in a test conducted by Stiftung Warentest where the products were unable to accurately track a bike ride.  17  Furthermore the determined values for the human energy transformation were erroneous.  17  With the heart rate large deviations have been observed at wristlet trackers and it is recommended for this purpose to use appropriate chest straps.  17  Wristbands can be uncomfortable to wear and inadvertently be lost. For some products genotoxic substances were detected.  17  Privacy concerns  edit  There have been some privacy issues regarding the data collection of activitytracking apps a users health can be tracked into a digital health footprint.  18  There have been many concerns about privacy issues with menstruation and reproductive healthtracking apps.  19  Many women who use these apps for menstrual and contraceptive tracking are under the impression that their data is private when there is no single body regulating the apps making the availability and protection of the data unknown.  19  The apps of some fitness trackers not only transmit personal data but also private address lists to servers on the Internet without notifying or asking the user.  17  Even when anonymized the mere presence of geolocation data may be a national security risk.  20  However the results of a study among semiprofessional half marathon participants suggest that certain users are open to sharing tracked activity data voluntarily.  21  In the US in 2013 BodyMedia developed a disposable fitness tracker to be worn for a week which is aimed at medical and insurance providers and employers seeking to measure employees fitness.  22  In 2014 Jawbone developed a system called UP for Groups which could provide employers with aggregated data from employees wearable fitness trackers and apps.  23  Psychological impacts  edit  Research has been carried out on the gamification of health apps where users earn incentives and rewards based on their health goals.  24  Though this can make the app engaging there was concern it could trivialize health apps and deter the users from their genuine health goals.  24  There is also research problematizing tracking devices about how we inhabit experience and imagine our bodies and lives.  25  Wearable sensors  edit  Wearable sensors have been widely used in medical sciences sports and security. Wearable sensors can detect abnormal and unforeseen situations and monitor physiological parameters and symptoms through these trackers.  This technology has transformed healthcare by allowing continuous monitoring of patients without hospitalization. Medical monitoring of a patients body temperature heart rate heart rate variability  26  brain activity muscle motion and other critical data can be delivered through these trackers. Moreover in sports training  there is an increasing demand for wearable sensors.  For example measurement of sweat rate was possible only in laboratorybased systems a few years ago but is now possible using wearable sensors.  27  Heart rate variability HRV has the potential to determine the quality of an exercise regimen. Additionally HRV is recommended among the athletic community as a warning sign for overtraining. In these ways HRV can be used to optimize performance.  26  Wearable sensors play a pivotal role in monitoring physiological parameters and enhancing fitness regimens through AIdriven feedback and the development of intelligent equipment. This is evident in collaborative efforts between leading sports brands and technology companies.  28  Medical uses  edit  Fitness trackers are not medical devices. However newer models approach the US definition of a Class II medical monitor  and some manufacturers hope to eventually make them capable of alerting to a medical problem although FDA approval would be required.  15  Detection of atrial fibrillation  edit  Activity tracking has been utilized to keep track of atrial fibrillation AF an irregular and chaotic heartbeat which is accountable for a majority of strokes in the United States.  29  Professionals rely on the ambulatory electrocardiogram EKG to record AF but soon found wearable wristbands  clarification needed  to be useful for regular usage.  clarification needed   29  These wearables must be accurate to prevent misdiagnosis morbidity and mortality.  29  The Apple Watch was found in a study to be able to detect and notify the wearer of an irregular pulse.  29  Though there is a risk of false positives the study found that it may be a useful tool in the initial diagnosis process as a gateway to additional procedures rather than being the only tool used.  29  Weight loss and obesity  edit  Fitness trackers have also been used for tracking and finding solutions to combat obesity by promoting physical activity.  30  A device called the Fitbit Alta was used as the wristband for adolescents who are considered obese where their steps distance calories burned activity time and sleep rates were kept track of and downloaded by the researchers to analyze.  30  The overall study found that societal and cultural factors were what affected adolescent obesity given that lowincome minorities were at a higher risk given that they had limited access to weight management programs and resources.  30  The tracking of steps and amount of physical activity allowed for one to be aware of their habits and lifestyle but the access to weight loss programs varied for many which is why the researchers utilized this information and used the technology to correlate behavioral aspects with the data to search for more solutions.  30  One review of six studies found that there was little evidence that fitness trackers improve health outcomes.  31  Of five studies that looked at weight loss one found benefit one found harm and three found no effect.  31  Another systematic review covering 35 studies and 7454 participants published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that fitness trackers increased peoples physical activity by an average of 1850 stepsday.  32  According to another study comparing 8week interventions and fourmonth followups of physical activity monitors a guided weight loss program and together activity monitoring and the weight loss program are associated with similar improvements and both combined are associated with more improvements than either alone.  31  It is unclear whether activity changes occur in children and adolescents.  32   33  Monitoring stress and mental illness  edit  There are many apps available in the Apple AppStore and the Samsung Google Play Store that deal with mental health management and selfhelp.  34  Smartwatches have also been involved in monitoring stress and other mental health issues.  35  A study was done analyzing the different types of devices ranging from bulky wearables to smaller portable devices with sensors that can detect depression anxiety and any form of stress.  35  Monitoring these main three factors is essential to understanding any risk and likelihood of additional health complications and the correlation to specific conditions.  35  Chest patches are used for measuring heart rate while the wristbands Chillbands were used to track activity where a correlation was seen in the HR levels and the involvement of circadian rhythm stress gender and age.  35  It was seen that detecting depression alone was challenging causing a risk of misdiagnosis but further research along with tracking of sleep physical activity mood changes cognitive function and social habits will help towards accurate measurements.  35  Monitoring infant growth development  edit  Wearable sensors  which  have also been in use when keeping track of infant development motor skills and physical growth are the main aspects that were focused on.  36  Parkinsons disease prediction  edit  Physical movement tracking can be used as a predictive analysis tool to determine the risk of Parkinsons Disease in individuals.  37  Alerting for caregivers  edit  Other fitness trackers are intended to monitor vital signs in the elderly epileptics and people with sleep disorders and alert a caregiver to a problem.  15  Menstrual tracking and reproductive health  edit  Individuals with a uterus can use menstrual tracking apps to keep track of their cycles and refer back to the timeline to spot any changes that they would like to bring up to their doctors or specialists.  19  There are several apps for this purpose but the privacy and security of the data are unknown given that there is no one head that oversees the system leaving a lot of the data open to the market leaving many questions as to how secure the data is when entered.  19  When users sign up for these apps they are usually led with an at your own risk warning in case any data gets leaked which can contribute to more targeted ads and inaccurate predictions in their cycles.  19  Animal health  edit  Fitness trackers have been designed for animals for example collarmounted fitness trackers for dogs.  38   39   40  See also  edit  Look up smart band in Wiktionary the free dictionary.
