Collection of compromised internetconnected devices controlled by a third party Stacheldraht botnet diagram showing a DDoS attack Note this is also an example of a type of clientserver model of a botnet. A botnet is a group of Internet connected devices each of which runs one or more bots . Botnets can be used to perform distributed denialofservice DDoS attacks steal data  1  send spam  and allow the attacker to access the device and its connection. The owner can control the botnet using command and control CC software.  2  The word botnet is a portmanteau of the words  robot  and  network . The term is usually used with a negative or malicious connotation. Overview  edit  A botnet is a logical collection of Internet connected devices such as computers smartphones or Internet of things IoT devices whose security have been breached and control ceded to a third party. Each compromised device known as a bot is created when a device is penetrated by software from a malware malicious software distribution. The controller of a botnet is able to direct the activities of these compromised computers through communication channels formed by standardsbased network protocols  such as IRC and Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP.  3   4  Botnets are increasingly rented out by cyber criminals as commodities for a variety of purposes  5  including as booterstresser services. Architecture  edit  Botnet architecture has evolved over time in an effort to evade detection and disruption. Traditionally bot programs are constructed as clients which communicate via existing servers. This allows the bot herder the controller of the botnet to perform all control from a remote location which obfuscates the traffic.  6  Many recent botnets now rely on existing peertopeer networks to communicate. These P2P bot programs perform the same actions as the clientserver model but they do not require a central server to communicate. Clientserver model  edit  A network based on the clientserver model  where individual clients request services and resources from centralized servers The first botnets on the Internet used a clientserver model to accomplish their tasks.  7  Typically these botnets operate through Internet Relay Chat networks domains  or websites . Infected clients access a predetermined location and await incoming commands from the server. The bot herder sends commands to the server which relays them to the clients. Clients execute the commands and report their results back to the bot herder. In the case of IRC botnets  infected clients connect to an infected IRC server and join a channel predesignated for CC by the bot herder. The bot herder sends commands to the channel via the IRC server. Each client retrieves the commands and executes them. Clients send messages back to the IRC channel with the results of their actions.  6  Peertopeer  edit  A peertopeer P2P network in which interconnected nodes peers share resources among each other without the use of a centralized administrative system In response to efforts to detect and decapitate IRC botnets bot herders have begun deploying malware on peertopeer networks. These bots may use digital signatures so that only someone with access to the private key can control the botnet  8  such as in Gameover ZeuS and the ZeroAccess botnet . Newer botnets fully operate over P2P networks. Rather than communicate with a centralized server P2P bots perform as both a command distribution server and a client which receives commands.  9  This avoids having any single point of failure which is an issue for centralized botnets. In order to find other infected machines P2P bots discreetly probe random IP addresses until they identify another infected machine. The contacted bot replies with information such as its software version and list of known bots. If one of the bots version is lower than the other they will initiate a file transfer to update.  8  This way each bot grows its list of infected machines and updates itself by periodically communicating to all known bots. Core components  edit  A botnets originator known as a  bot herder  or bot master controls the botnet remotely. This is known as the commandandcontrol CC. The program for the operation must communicate via a covert channel to the client on the victims machine zombie computer. Control protocols  edit  IRC is a historically favored means of CC because of its communication protocol . A bot herder creates an IRC channel for infected clients to join. Messages sent to the channel are broadcast to all channel members. The bot herder may set the channels topic to command the botnet. For example the message herderherderexample.com TOPIC channel DDoS www.victim.com from the bot herder alerts all infected clients belonging to channel to begin a DDoS attack on the website www.victim.com. An example response bot1bot1compromised.net PRIVMSG channel I am DDoSing www.victim.com by a bot client alerts the bot herder that it has begun the attack.  8  Some botnets implement custom versions of wellknown protocols. The implementation differences can be used for detection of botnets. For example MegaD features a slightly modified Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP implementation for testing spam capability. Bringing down the MegaD s SMTP server disables the entire pool of bots that rely upon the same SMTP server.  10  Zombie computer  edit  In computer science  a zombie computer is a computer connected to the Internet that has been compromised by a hacker  computer virus or trojan horse and can be used to perform malicious tasks under remote direction. Botnets of zombie computers are often used to spread email spam and launch denialofservice attacks DDoS. Most owners of zombie computers are unaware that their system is being used in this way. Because the owner tends to be unaware these computers are metaphorically compared to zombies . A coordinated DDoS attack by multiple botnet machines also resembles a zombie horde attack.  11  The process of stealing computing resources as a result of a system being joined to a botnet is sometimes referred to as scrumping.  12  Global law enforcement agencies with the DOJ and FBI dismantled the 911 S5 botnet responsible for 5.9 billion in theft and various cybercrimes. Chinese national YunHe Wang charged with operating the botnet faces up to 65 years in prison. Authorities seized 60 million in assets including luxury items and properties.  13  Command and control  edit  Botnet command and control CC protocols have been implemented in a number of ways from traditional IRC approaches to more sophisticated versions. Telnet  edit  Telnet botnets use a simple CC botnet protocol in which bots connect to the main command server to host the botnet. Bots are added to the botnet by using a scanning script  which runs on an external server and scans IP ranges for telnet and SSH server default logins. Once a login is found the scanning server can infect it through SSH with malware which pings the control server. IRC  edit  IRC networks use simple low bandwidth communication methods making them widely used to host botnets. They tend to be relatively simple in construction and have been used with moderate success for coordinating DDoS attacks and spam campaigns while being able to continually switch channels to avoid being taken down. However in some cases merely blocking of certain keywords has proven effective in stopping IRCbased botnets. The RFC 1459  IRC  standard is popular with botnets. The first known popular botnet controller script MaXiTE Bot was using IRC XDCC protocol for private control commands. One problem with using IRC is that each bot client must know the IRC server port and channel to be of any use to the botnet. Antimalware organizations can detect and shut down these servers and channels effectively halting the botnet attack. If this happens clients are still infected but they typically lie dormant since they have no way of receiving instructions.  8  To mitigate this problem a botnet can consist of several servers or channels. If one of the servers or channels becomes disabled the botnet simply switches to another. It is still possible to detect and disrupt additional botnet servers or channels by sniffing IRC traffic. A botnet adversary can even potentially gain knowledge of the control scheme and imitate the bot herder by issuing commands correctly.  14  P2P  edit  Since most botnets using IRC networks and domains can be taken down with time hackers have moved to P2P botnets with CC to make the botnet more resilient and resistant to termination. Some have also used encryption as a way to secure or lock down the botnet from others most of the time when they use encryption it is publickey cryptography and has presented challenges in both implementing it and breaking it. Domains  edit  Many large botnets tend to use domains rather than IRC in their construction see Rustock botnet and Srizbi botnet . They are usually hosted with bulletproof hosting services. This is one of the earliest types of CC. A zombie computer accesses a speciallydesigned webpage or domains which serves the list of controlling commands. The advantages of using web pages or domains as CC is that a large botnet can be effectively controlled and maintained with very simple code that can be readily updated. Disadvantages of using this method are that it uses a considerable amount of bandwidth at large scale and domains can be quickly seized by government agencies with little effort. If the domains controlling the botnets are not seized they are also easy targets to compromise with denialofservice attacks . Fastflux DNS can be used to make it difficult to track down the control servers which may change from day to day. Control servers may also hop from DNS domain to DNS domain with domain generation algorithms being used to create new DNS names for controller servers. Some botnets use free DNS hosting services such as DynDns.org  NoIP.com  and Afraid.org to point a subdomain towards an IRC server that harbors the bots. While these free DNS services do not themselves host attacks they provide reference points often hardcoded into the botnet executable. Removing such services can cripple an entire botnet. Others  edit  Calling back to popular sites  15  such as GitHub   16  Twitter   17   18  Reddit   19  Instagram   20  the XMPP open source instant message protocol  21  and Tor hidden services  22  are popular ways of avoiding egress filtering to communicate with a CC server.  23  Construction  edit  Traditional  edit  This example illustrates how a botnet is created and used for malicious gain. A hacker purchases or builds a Trojan andor exploit kit and uses it to start infecting users computers whose payload is a malicious applicationthe bot . The bot instructs the infected PC to connect to a particular commandandcontrol CC server. This allows the botmaster to keep logs of how many bots are active and online. The botmaster may then use the bots to gather keystrokes or use form grabbing to steal online credentials and may rent out the botnet as DDoS andor spam as a service or sell the credentials online for a profit. Depending on the quality and capability of the bots the value is increased or decreased. Newer bots can automatically scan their environment and propagate themselves using vulnerabilities and weak passwords. Generally the more vulnerabilities a bot can scan and propagate through the more valuable it becomes to a botnet controller community.  24  Computers can be coopted into a botnet when they execute malicious software. This can be accomplished by luring users into making a driveby download  exploiting web browser vulnerabilities  or by tricking the user into running a Trojan horse program which may come from an email attachment. This malware will typically install modules that allow the computer to be commanded and controlled by the botnets operator. After the software is downloaded it will call home send a reconnection packet  to the host computer. When the reconnection is made depending on how it is written a Trojan may then delete itself or may remain present to update and maintain the modules. Others  edit  In some cases a botnet may be temporarily created by volunteer hacktivists  such as with implementations of the Low Orbit Ion Cannon as used by 4chan members during Project Chanology in 2010.  25  Chinas Great Cannon of China allows the modification of legitimate web browsing traffic at internet backbones into China to create a large ephemeral botnet to attack large targets such as GitHub in 2015.  26  Common uses  edit  Distributed denialofservice attacks are one of the most common uses for botnets in which multiple systems submit as many requests as possible to a single Internet computer or service overloading it and preventing it from servicing legitimate requests. An example is an attack on a victims server. The victims server is bombarded with requests by the bots attempting to connect to the server therefore overloading it. Google fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder has said that these types of attacks causing outages on major websites will continue to occur regularly due the use of botnets as a service.  27  Spyware is software which sends information to its creators about a users activities  typically passwords credit card numbers and other information that can be sold on the black market. Compromised machines that are located within a corporate network can be worth more to the bot herder as they can often gain access to confidential corporate information. Several targeted attacks on large corporations aimed to steal sensitive information such as the Aurora botnet.  28  Email spam are email messages disguised as messages from people but are either advertising annoying or malicious. Click fraud occurs when the users computer visits websites without the users awareness to create false web traffic for personal or commercial gain.  29  Ad fraud is often a consequence of malicious bot activity according to CHEQ Ad Fraud 2019 The Economic Cost of Bad Actors on the Internet.  30  Commercial purposes of bots include influencers using them to boost their supposed popularity and online publishers using bots to increase the number of clicks an ad receives allowing sites to earn more commission from advertisers. Credential stuffing attacks use botnets to log in to many user accounts with stolen passwords such as in the attack against General Motors in 2022.  31  Bitcoin mining was used in some of the more recent botnets have which include bitcoin mining as a feature in order to generate profits for the operator of the botnet.  32   33  Selfspreading functionality to seek for preconfigured commandandcontrol CNC pushed instruction contains targeted devices or network to aim for more infection is also spotted in several botnets. Some of the botnets are utilizing this function to automate their infections. Market  edit  The botnet controller community constantly competes over who has the most bots the highest overall bandwidth and the most highquality infected machines like university corporate and even government machines.  34  While botnets are often named after the malware that created them multiple botnets typically use the same malware but are operated by different entities.  35  Phishing  edit  Botnets can be used for many electronic scams. These botnets can be used to distribute malware such as viruses to take control of a regular users computersoftware  36  By taking control of someones personal computer they have unlimited access to their personal information including passwords and login information to accounts. This is called phishing . Phishing is the acquiring of login information to the victims accounts with a link the victim clicks on that is sent through an email or text.  37  A survey by Verizon found that around twothirds of electronic espionage cases come from phishing.  38  Countermeasures  edit  The geographic dispersal of botnets means that each recruit must be individually identifiedcorralledrepaired and limits the benefits of filtering . Computer security experts have succeeded in destroying or subverting malware command and control networks by among other means seizing servers or getting them cut off from the Internet denying access to domains that were due to be used by malware to contact its CC infrastructure and in some cases breaking into the CC network itself.  39   40   41  In response to this CC operators have resorted to using techniques such as overlaying their CC networks on other existing benign infrastructure such as IRC or Tor  using peertopeer networking systems that are not dependent on any fixed servers and using public key encryption to defeat attempts to break into or spoof the network.  42  Norton AntiBot was aimed at consumers but most target enterprises andor ISPs. Hostbased techniques use heuristics to identify bot behavior that has bypassed conventional antivirus software . Networkbased approaches tend to use the techniques described above shutting down CC servers nullrouting DNS entries or completely shutting down IRC servers. BotHunter is software developed with support from the U.S. Army Research Office  that detects botnet activity within a network by analyzing network traffic and comparing it to patterns characteristic of malicious processes. Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories are analyzing botnets behavior by simultaneously running one million Linux kernelsa similar scale to a botnetas virtual machines on a 4480node highperformance computer cluster to emulate a very large network allowing them to watch how botnets work and experiment with ways to stop them.  43  Detecting automated bot becomes more difficult as newer and more sophisticated generations of bots get launched by attackers. For example an automated attack can deploy a large bot army and apply bruteforce methods with highly accurate username and password lists to hack into accounts. The idea is to overwhelm sites with tens of thousands of requests from different IPs all over the world but with each bot only submitting a single request every 10 minutes or so which can result in more than 5 million attempts per day.  44  In these cases many tools try to leverage volumetric detection but automated bot attacks now have ways of circumventing triggers of volumetric detection. One of the techniques for detecting these bot attacks is whats known as signaturebased systems in which the software will attempt to detect patterns in the request packet. However attacks are constantly evolving so this may not be a viable option when patterns cannot be discerned from thousands of requests. There is also the behavioral approach to thwarting bots which ultimately tries to distinguish bots from humans. By identifying nonhuman behavior and recognizing known bot behavior this process can be applied at the user browser and network levels. The most capable method of using software to combat against a virus has been to utilize honeypot software in order to convince the malware that a system is vulnerable. The malicious files are then analyzed using forensic software. On 15 July 2014 the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism of the Committee  45  on the Judiciary United States Senate  held a hearing on the threats posed by botnets and the public and private efforts to disrupt and dismantle them.  46  The rise in vulnerable IoT devices has led to an increase in IoTbased botnet attacks. To address this a novel networkbased anomaly detection method for IoT called NBaIoT was introduced. It captures network behavior snapshots and employs deep autoencoders to identify abnormal traffic from compromised IoT devices. The method was tested by infecting nine IoT devices with Mirai and BASHLITE botnets showing its ability to accurately and promptly detect attacks originating from compromised IoT devices within a botnet.  47  Additionally comparing different ways of detecting botnets is really useful for researchers. It helps them see how well each method works compared to others. This kind of comparison is good because it lets researchers evaluate the methods fairly and find ways to make them better.  48  Historical list of botnets  edit  The first botnet was first acknowledged and exposed by EarthLink during a lawsuit with notorious spammer Khan C. Smith  49  in 2001. The botnet was constructed for the purpose of bulk spam and accounted for nearly 25 of all spam at the time.  50  Around 2006 to thwart detection some botnets were scaling back in size.  51  Date created Date dismantled Name Estimated no. of bots Spam capacity bnday Aliases 1999 a 999999999 100000 a 2003 MaXiTE 5001000 servers 0 MaXiTE XDCC Bot MaXiTE IRC TCL Script MaxServ 2004 Early Bagle 230000  52  5.7 Beagle Mitglieder Lodeight Marina Botnet 6215000  52  92 Damon Briant BOB.dc Cotmonger Hacktool.Spammer Kraken Torpig 180000  53  Sinowal Anserin Storm 160000  54  3 Nuwar Peacomm Zhelatin 2006 around 2011 March Rustock 150000  55  30 RKRustok Costrat Donbot 125000  56  0.8 Buzus Bachsoy 2007 around Cutwail 1500000  57  74 Pandex Mutant related to Wigon Pushdo 2007 Akbot 1300000  58  2007 March 2008 November Srizbi 450000  59  60 Cbeplay Exchanger Lethic 260000  52  2 none Xarvester 10000  52  0.15 Rlsloup Pixoliz 2008 around Sality 1000000  60  Sector Kuku 2008 around 2009Dec Mariposa 12000000  61  2008 around Kraken 495000  62  9 Kracken 2008 November Conficker 10500000  63  10 DownUp DownAndUp DownAdUp Kido 2008 November 2010 March Waledac 80000  64  1.5 Waled Waledpak Maazben 50000  52  0.5 None Onewordsub 40000  65  1.8 Gheg 30000  52  0.24 Tofsee Mondera Nucrypt 20000  65  5 Loosky Locksky Wopla 20000  65  0.6 Pokier Slogger Cryptic 2008 around Asprox 15000  66  Danmec Hydraflux 0 Spamthru 12000  65  0.35 SpamDComServ Covesmer Xmiler 2008 around Gumblar 2009 May November 2010 not complete BredoLab 30000000  67  3.6 Oficla 2009 Around 20120719 Grum 560000  68  39.9 Tedroo MegaD 509000  69  10 Ozdok 2009 August Festi 250000  70  2.25 Spamnost 2010 March Vulcanbot 2010 January LowSec 11000  52  0.5 LowSecurity FreeMoney Ring0.Tools 2010 around TDL4 4500000  71  TDSS Alureon Zeus 3600000 US only  72  Zbot PRG Wsnpoem Gorhax Kneber 2010 Several 2011 2012 Kelihos 300000 4 Hlux 2011 or earlier 201502 Ramnit 3000000  73  2012 Around Chameleon 120000  74  None 2014 Necurs 6000000 2016 August Mirai 380000 None 2022 Mantis  75  5000 Researchers at the University of California Santa Barbara took control of a botnet that was six times smaller than expected.

Estimating the size of the botnet by the number of IP addresses is often used by researchers possibly leading to inaccurate assessments.  76  See also  edit  Computer security Computer worm Spambot Timeline of computer viruses and worms Advanced Persistent Threat Volunteer computing References  edit   Thingbots The Future of Botnets in the Internet of Things .
