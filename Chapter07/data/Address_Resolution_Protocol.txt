Link layer ARP Tunnels PPP MAC more... v t e The Address Resolution Protocol  ARP  is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address such as a MAC address  associated with a given internet layer address typically an IPv4 address . This mapping is a critical function in the Internet protocol suite . ARP was defined in 1982 by RFC 826  which is Internet Standard STD 37. ARP is required when a host wants to send an IPv4 packet to another node within the same network but doesnt know that nodes MAC address yet. The host broadcasts an ARP request containing the nodes IP address and the node with the corresponding IP address returns an ARP reply that contains its MAC address. ARP has been implemented with many combinations of network and data link layer technologies such as IPv4  Chaosnet  DECnet and Xerox PARC Universal Packet PUP using IEEE 802 standards FDDI  X.25  Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM. In Internet Protocol Version 6 IPv6 networks the functionality of ARP is provided by the Neighbor Discovery Protocol NDP. Operating scope  edit  The Address Resolution Protocol is a requestresponse protocol. Its messages are directly encapsulated by a link layer protocol. It is communicated within the boundaries of a single subnetwork and is never routed . Packet structure  edit  The Address Resolution Protocol uses a simple message format containing one address resolution request or response. The packets are carried at the data link layer of the underlying network as raw payload. In the case of Ethernet a 0x0806 EtherType value is used to identify ARP frames. The size of the ARP message depends on the link layer and network layer address sizes. The message header specifies the types of network in use at each layer as well as the size of addresses of each. The message header is completed with the operation code for request 1 and reply 2. The payload of the packet consists of four addresses the hardware and protocol address of the sender and receiver hosts. The principal packet structure of ARP packets is shown in the following table which illustrates the case of IPv4 networks running on Ethernet. In this scenario the packet has 48bit fields for the sender hardware address SHA and target hardware address THA and 32bit fields for the corresponding sender and target protocol addresses SPA and TPA. The ARP packet size in this case is 28 bytes.

Target Hardware Address 20 160 24 192 Target Protocol Address Hardware Type HTYPE 16 bits This field specifies the network link protocol type.  1  In this example a value of 1 indicates Ethernet . Protocol Type PTYPE 16 bits This field specifies the internetwork protocol for which the ARP request is intended. For IPv4 this has the value 0x0800 . The permitted PTYPE values share a numbering space with those for EtherType .  1   2  Hardware Length HLEN 8 bits Length in octets  of a hardware address. For Ethernet the address length is 6 . Protocol Length PLEN 8 bits Length in octets of internetwork addresses. The internetwork protocol is specified in PTYPE. In this example IPv4 address length is 4 . Operation OPER 16 bits Specifies the operation that the sender is performing 1 for request 2 for reply. Sender Hardware Address SHA 48 bits Media address of the sender. In an ARP request this field is used to indicate the address of the host sending the request. In an ARP reply this field is used to indicate the address of the host that the request was looking for. Sender protocol address SPA 32 bits Internetwork address of the sender. Target hardware address THA 48 bits Media address of the intended receiver. In an ARP request this field is ignored. In an ARP reply this field is used to indicate the address of the host that originated the ARP request. Target protocol address TPA 32 bits Internetwork address of the intended receiver. ARP parameter values have been standardized and are maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority IANA.  1  The EtherType for ARP is 0x0806 . This appears in the Ethernet frame header when the payload is an ARP packet and is not to be confused with PTYPE which appears within this encapsulated ARP packet. Layering  edit  ARPs placement within the Internet protocol suite and the OSI model may be a matter of confusion or even of dispute. RFC 826 places it into the Link Layer and characterizes it as a tool to inquire about the higher level layer such as the Internet layer.  3  RFC 1122 also discusses ARP in its link layer section.  4  Richard Stevens places ARP in OSIs data link layer  5  while newer editions associate it with the network layer or introduce an intermediate OSI layer 2.5.  6  Example  edit  Two computers in an office  Computer 1 and Computer 2  are connected to each other in a local area network by Ethernet cables and network switches  with no intervening gateways or routers . Computer 1 has a packet to send to Computer 2 . Through DNS  it determines that Computer 2 has the IP address 192.168.0.55 . To send the message it also requires Computer 2  s MAC address . First Computer 1 uses a cached ARP table to look up 192.168.0.55 for any existing records of Computer 2 s MAC address  00EB24B205AC . If the MAC address is found it sends an Ethernet frame containing the IP packet onto the link with the destination address 00EB24B205AC . If the cache did not produce a result for 192.168.0.55  Computer 1 has to send a broadcast ARP request message destination FFFFFFFFFFFF MAC address which is accepted by all computers on the local network requesting an answer for 192.168.0.55 . Computer 2 responds with an ARP response message containing its MAC and IP addresses. As part of fielding the request Computer 2 may insert an entry for Computer 1 into its ARP table for future use. Computer 1 receives and caches the response information in its ARP table and can now send the packet.  7  ARP probe  edit  An ARP probe in IPv4 is an ARP request constructed with the SHA of the probing host an SPA of all 0s a THA of all 0s and a TPA set to the IPv4 address being probed for.  If some host on the network regards the IPv4 address in the TPA as its own it will reply to the probe via the SHA of the probing host thus informing the probing host of the address conflict.  If instead there is no host which regards the IPv4 address as its own then there will be no reply.  When several such probes have been sent with slight delays and none receive replies it can reasonably be expected that no conflict exists.  As the original probe packet contains neither a valid SHASPA nor a valid THATPA pair there is no risk of any host using the packet to update its cache with problematic data.  Before beginning to use an IPv4 address whether received from manual configuration DHCP or some other means a host implementing this specification must test to see if the address is already in use by broadcasting ARP probe packets.  8   9  ARP announcements  edit  ARP may also be used as a simple announcement protocol. This is useful for updating other hosts mappings of a hardware address when the senders IP address or MAC address changes. Such an announcement also called a gratuitous ARP GARP message is usually broadcast as an ARP request containing the SPA in the target field TPASPA with THA set to zero. An alternative way is to broadcast an ARP reply with the senders SHA and SPA duplicated in the target fields TPASPA THASHA. The ARP request and ARP reply announcements are both standardsbased methods  10   4.6 but the ARP request method is preferred.  11   3 Some devices may be configured for the use of either of these two types of announcements.  12  An ARP announcement is not intended to solicit a reply instead it updates any cached entries in the ARP tables of other hosts that receive the packet. The operation code in the announcement may be either request or reply the ARP standard specifies that the opcode is only processed after the ARP table has been updated from the address fields.  13   10   4.6  14   4.4.1 Many operating systems issue an ARP announcement during startup. This helps to resolve problems that would otherwise occur if for example a network card was recently changed changing the IPaddresstoMACaddress mapping and other hosts still have the old mapping in their ARP caches. ARP announcements are also used by some network interfaces to provide load balancing for incoming traffic. In a team of network cards it is used to announce a different MAC address within the team that should receive incoming packets. ARP announcements can be used in the Zeroconf protocol to allow automatic assignment of a linklocal address to an interface where no other IP address configuration is available. The announcements are used to ensure an address chosen by a host is not in use by other hosts on the network link.  15  This function can be dangerous from a cybersecurity viewpoint since an attacker can obtain information about the other hosts of its subnet to save in their ARP cache  ARP spoofing  an entry where the attacker MAC is associated for instance to the IP of the default gateway  thus allowing them to intercept all the traffic to external networks. ARP mediation  edit  ARP mediation refers to the process of resolving Layer2 addresses through a virtual private wire service VPWS when different resolution protocols are used on the connected circuits e.g. Ethernet on one end and Frame Relay on the other.  In IPv4  each provider edge PE device discovers the IP address of the locally attached customer edge CE device and distributes that IP address to the corresponding remote PE device.  Then each PE device responds to local ARP requests using the IP address of the remote CE device and the hardware address of the local PE device.  In IPv6  each PE device discovers the IP address of both local and remote CE devices and then intercepts local Neighbor Discovery ND and Inverse Neighbor Discovery IND packets and forwards them to the remote PE device.  16  Inverse ARP and Reverse ARP  edit  Inverse Address Resolution Protocol  Inverse ARP or InARP  is used to obtain network layer addresses for example IP addresses  of other nodes from data link layer Layer 2 addresses. Since ARP translates layer3 addresses to layer2 addresses InARP may be described as its inverse. In addition InARP is implemented as a protocol extension to ARP it uses the same packet format as ARP but different operation codes. InARP is primarily used in Frame Relay  DLCI  and ATM networks in which layer2 addresses of virtual circuits are sometimes obtained from layer2 signaling and the corresponding layer3 addresses must be available before those virtual circuits can be used.  17  The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol Reverse ARP or RARP like InARP translates layer2 addresses to layer3 addresses. However in InARP the requesting station queries the layer3 address of another node whereas RARP is used to obtain the layer3 address of the requesting station itself for address configuration purposes. RARP is obsolete it was replaced by BOOTP  which was later superseded by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol DHCP.  18  ARP spoofing and proxy ARP  edit  Main articles ARP spoofing and Proxy ARP A successful ARP spoofing attack allows an attacker to perform a maninthemiddle attack . Because ARP does not provide methods for authenticating ARP replies on a network ARP replies can come from systems other than the one with the required Layer 2 address.  An ARP proxy is a system that answers the ARP request on behalf of another system for which it will forward traffic normally as a part of the networks design such as for a dialup internet service. By contrast in ARP spoofing the answering system or spoofer  replies to a request for another systems address with the aim of intercepting data bound for that system. A malicious user may use ARP spoofing to perform a maninthemiddle or denialofservice attack on other users on the network. Various software exists to both detect and perform ARP spoofing attacks though ARP itself does not provide any methods of protection from such attacks.  19  Alternatives  edit  IPv6 uses the Neighbor Discovery Protocol and its extensions such as Secure Neighbor Discovery  rather than ARP. Computers can maintain lists of known addresses rather than using an active protocol. In this model each computer maintains a database of the mapping of Layer 3 addresses e.g. IP addresses  to Layer 2 addresses e.g. Ethernet MAC addresses . This data is maintained primarily by interpreting ARP packets from the local network link. Thus it is often called the ARP cache . Since at least the 1980s  20  networked computers have a utility called arp for interrogating or manipulating this database.  21   22   23  Historically other methods were used to maintain the mapping between addresses such as static configuration files  24  or centrally maintained lists. ARP stuffing  edit  Embedded systems such as networked cameras  25  and networked power distribution devices  26  which lack a user interface can use socalled ARP stuffing to make an initial network connection although this is a misnomer as ARP is not involved. ARP stuffing is accomplished as follows The users computer has an IP address stuffed manually into its address table normally with the arp command with the MAC address taken from a label on the device The computer sends special packets to the device typically a ping packet with a nondefault size. The device then adopts this IP address The user then communicates with it by telnet or web protocols to complete the configuration. Such devices typically have a method to disable this process once the device is operating normally as the capability can make it vulnerable to attack.
