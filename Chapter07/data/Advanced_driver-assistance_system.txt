Electronic systems that help a vehicle driver while driving or parking For broader coverage of this topic see Vehicular automation . Advanced driverassistance systems Assisted control of distance from the leading car centering in lane enabled in a Tesla  1  Industry Automotive Application Automobile Components Sensors typically cameras  proximity  andor lidar  microprocessors  software  and actuators Examples Adaptive cruise control Lane centering Handsfree driving Advanced driverassistance systems  ADAS  are technologies that assist drivers with the safe operation of a vehicle. Through a humanmachine interface  ADAS increase car and road safety. ADAS use automated technology such as sensors and cameras to detect nearby obstacles or driver errors and respond accordingly. ADAS can enable various levels of autonomous driving . As most road crashes occur due to human error   2  ADAS are developed to automate adapt and enhance vehicle technology for safety and better driving. ADAS are proven to reduce road fatalities by minimizing human error.  3  Safety features are designed to avoid crashes and collisions by offering technologies that alert the driver to problems implementing safeguards and taking control of the vehicle if necessary. ADAS may provide adaptive cruise control  assist in avoiding collisions  alert drivers to possible obstacles warn of lane departure  assist in lane centering  incorporate satellite navigation  provide traffic warnings provide navigational assistance through smartphones automate lighting or provide other features.  3  According to the national crash database in the US Forward Collision Prevention systems have the potential to reduce crashes by 29. Similarly Lane Keeping Assistance is shown to offer a reduction potential of 19 while Blind Zone Detection could decrease crash incidents by 9.  4  According to a 2021 research report from Canalys approximately 33 percent of new vehicles sold in the United States Europe Japan and China had ADAS. The firm also predicted that fifty percent of all automobiles on the road by the year 2030 would be ADASenabled.  5  Terminology  edit  Some groups advocate standardization of the name such as Forward Collision Warning and Automatic Emergency Braking rather than Forward Collision Alert or Smart City Brake Support.  6  Such standardization is promoted by AAA  Consumer Reports  J.D. Power  National Safety Council  PAVE  and SAE International .  7  Concept history and development  edit  ADAS were first being used in the 1970s with the adoption of the antilock braking system.  8  Early ADAS include electronic stability control antilock brakes blind spot information systems lane departure warning adaptive cruise control and traction control. These systems can be affected by mechanical alignment adjustments or damage from a collision. This has led many manufacturers to require automatic resets for these systems after a mechanical alignment is performed.  citation needed  Technical concepts  edit  The reliance on data that describes the outside environment of the vehicle compared to internal data differentiates ADAS from driverassistance systems DAS.  8  ADAS rely on inputs from multiple data sources including automotive imaging LiDAR  radar  image processing  computer vision  and incar networking. Additional inputs are possible from other sources separate from the primary vehicle platform including other vehicles  vehicletovehicle or V2V communication  and infrastructure  vehicletoinfrastructure or V2I communication .  9  Modern cars have ADAS integrated into their electronics manufacturers can add these new features during the design process or after production via overtheair OTA updates . ADAS are considered realtime systems since they react quickly to multiple inputs and prioritize the incoming information to prevent crashes.  10  The systems use preemptive priority scheduling to organize which task needs to be done first.  10  The incorrect assignment of these priorities is what can cause more harm than good.  10  ADAS levels  edit  See also Selfdriving car  Levels of driving automation ADAS are categorized into different levels based on the amount of automation and the scale provided by The Society of Automotive Engineers SAE.  8  ADAS can be divided into six levels. In level 0 ADAS cannot control the car and can only provide information for the driver to interpret on their own.  8  Some ADAS that are considered level 0 are parking sensors surroundview traffic sign recognition lane departure warning night vision blind spot information system rearcross traffic alert and forwardcollision warning.  8  Level 1 and 2 are very similar in that they both have the driver do most of the decision making. The difference is level 1 can take control over one functionality and level 2 can take control over multiple to aid the driver.  8  ADAS that are considered level 1 are adaptive cruise control emergency brake assist automatic emergency brake assist lanekeeping and lane centering.  8  ADAS that are considered level 2 are highway assist autonomous obstacle avoidance and autonomous parking.  8  From level 3 to 5 the amount of control the vehicle has increases level 5 being where the vehicle is fully autonomous. Some of these systems have not yet been fully embedded in commercial vehicles. For instance highway chauffeur is a Level 3 system and automated valet parking is a level 4 system both of which are not in full commercial use in 2019.  8  The levels can be roughly understood as Level 0  no automation Level 1  hands onshared control Level 2  hands off Level 3  eyes off Level 4  mind off and Level 5  steering wheel optional.  11  Feature examples  edit  This list is not a comprehensive list of all of the ADAS. Instead it provides information on critical examples of ADAS that have progressed and become more commonly available since 2015.  12   13  Alerts and warnings Blind spot monitor involves cameras that monitor the drivers blind spots and notify the driver if any obstacles come close to the vehicle.  14  Blind spots are defined as the areas behind or at the side of the vehicle that the driver cannot see from the drivers seat.  14  Blindspot monitoring systems typically work in conjunction with emergency braking systems to act accordingly if any obstacles come into the vehicles path. A rear cross traffic alert RCTA typically works in conjunction with the blind spot monitoring system warning the driver of approaching crosstraffic when reversing out of a parking spot.  15  Driver drowsiness detection aims to prevent collisions due to driver fatigue.  16  The vehicle obtains information such as facial patterns steering movement driving habits turn signal use and driving velocity to determine if the drivers activities correspond with drowsy driving.  17  If drowsy driving is suspected the vehicle will typically sound off a loud alert and may vibrate the drivers seat.  17  Infrared LEDs for driver monitoring system illumination Driver monitoring system is designed to monitor the alertness of the driver.  18  These systems use biological and performance measures to assess the drivers alertness and ability to conduct safe driving practices.  18  Currently these systems use infrared sensors and cameras to monitor the drivers attentiveness through eyetracking.  18  If the vehicle detects a possible obstacle it will notify the driver and if no action is taken the vehicle may react to the obstacle. Electric vehicle warning sounds notify pedestrians and cyclists that a hybrid or plugin electric vehicle is nearby typically delivered through a noise such as a beep or horn.  19  This technology was developed in response to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ruling that issued 50 percent of quiet vehicles must have a device implemented into their systems that sound off when the vehicle travels at speeds less than 30 kmh 18.6 mph by September 2019.  20  Forward collision warning FCW monitor the speed of the vehicle and the vehicle in front of it and the open distance around the vehicle.  21  FCW systems will send an alert to the driver of a possible impending collision if gets too close to the vehicle in front of it.  21  These systems do not take control of the vehicle as currently FCW systems only send an alert signal to the driver in the form of an audio alert visual popup display or other warning alert.  21  Intelligent speed adaptation or intelligent speed advice ISA assists drivers with compliance to the speed limit. They take in information of the vehicles position and notify the driver when they are  not enforcing the speed limit.  22  Some ISA systems allow the vehicle to adjust its speed to adhere to the relative speed limit.  22  Other ISA systems only warn the driver when they are going over the speed limit and leave it up to the driver to enforce the speed limit or not.  22  Intersection assistants use two radar sensors in the front bumper and sides of the car to monitor if there are any oncoming cars at intersections highway exits or car parks.  23  This system alerts the driver of any upcoming traffic from the vehicles sides and can enact the vehicles emergency braking system to prevent the collision.  23  Lane departure warning system LDW alerts the driver when they partially merge into a lane without using their turn signals.  24  An LDW system uses cameras to monitor lane markings to determine if the driver unintentionally begins to drift.  24  This system does not take control of the vehicle to help sway the car back into the safety zone but instead sends an audio or visual alert to the driver.  24  Parking sensors can scan the vehicles surroundings for objects when the driver initiates parking.  25  Audio warnings can notify the driver of the distance between the vehicle and its surrounding objects.  25  Typically the faster the audio warnings are issued the closer the vehicle is getting to the object.  25  These sensors may not detect objects closer to the ground such as parking stops which is why parking sensors typically work alongside backup cameras to assist the driver when reversing into a parking spot.  25  TPMS low pressure warning icon Tire pressure monitoring determine when the tire pressure is outside the normal inflation pressure range.  26  The driver can monitor the tire pressure and is notified when there is a sudden drop through a pictogram display gauge or lowpressure warning signal.  26  Vibrating seat warnings alert the driver of danger. GMs Cadillacs have offered vibrating seat warnings since the 2013 Cadillac ATS. If the driver begins drifting out of the traveling lane of a highway the seat vibrates in the direction of the drift warning the driver of danger. The safety alert seat also provides a vibrating pulse on both sides of the seat when a frontal threat is detected.  27  Wrongway driving warning issue alerts to drivers when it is detected that they are on the wrong side of the road.  28  Vehicles with this system enacted can use sensors and cameras to identify the direction of oncoming traffic flow.  28  In conjunction with lane detection services this system can also notify drivers when they partially merge into the wrong side of the road  28  Crash mitigation  edit  Pedestrian protection systems are designed to minimize the number of crashes or injuries that occur between a vehicle and a pedestrian.  29  This system uses cameras and sensors to determine when the front of a vehicle strikes a pedestrian.  29  When the collision occurs the vehicles bonnet lifts to provide a cushion between the vehicles hard engine components and the pedestrian.  29  This helps minimize the possibility of a severe head injury when the pedestrians head comes into contact with the vehicle.  29  Driving task assistance  edit  Adaptive cruise control ACC can maintain a chosen velocity and distance between a vehicle and the vehicle ahead. ACC can automatically brake or accelerate with concern to the distance between the vehicle and the vehicle ahead.  30  ACC systems with stop and go features can come to a complete stop and accelerate back to the specified speed.  31  This system still requires an alert driver to take in their surroundings as it only controls speed and the distance between you and the car in front of you.  30  Symbol for ABS Antilock braking system ABS restore traction to a cars tires by regulating the brake pressure when the vehicle begins to skid.  32  Alongside helping drivers in emergencies such as when their car starts to skid on ice ABS systems can also assist drivers who may lose control of their vehicle.  32  With the growing popularity in the 1990s ABS systems have become standard in vehicles.  32  Automatic parking  demonstrated by handsoff driver Automatic parking fully takes over control of parking functions including steering braking and acceleration to assist drivers in parking.  33  Depending on the relative cars and obstacles the vehicle positions itself safely into the available parking spot.  33  Currently the driver must still be aware of the vehicles surroundings and be willing to take control of it if necessary. Collision avoidance system precrash system uses small radar detectors typically placed near the front of the car to determine the cars vicinity to nearby obstacles and notify the driver of potential car crash situations.  34  These systems can account for any sudden changes to the cars environment that may cause a collision.  34  Systems can respond to a possible collision situation with multiple actions such as sounding an alarm tensing up passengers seat belts closing a sunroof and raising reclined seats.  34  Crosswind stabilization helps prevent a vehicle from overturning when strong winds hit its side by analyzing  the vehicles yaw rate steering angle lateral acceleration and velocity sensors.  35  This system distributes the wheel load in relation to the velocity and direction of the crosswind.  35  Cruise control can maintain a specific speed predetermined by the driver.  36  The car will maintain the speed the driver sets until the driver hits the brake pedal clutch pedal or disengages the system.  36  Specific cruise control systems can accelerate or decelerate but require the driver to click a button and notify the car of the goal speed.  36  ESC control light Electronic stability control ESC can reduce the speed of the car and activate individual brakes to prevent understeer and oversteer.  37  Understeer occurs when the cars front wheels do not have enough traction to make the car turn and oversteer occurs when the car turns more than intended causing the car to spin out.  37  In conjunction with other car safety technologies such as antilock braking and traction control the ESC can safely help drivers maintain control of the car in unforeseen situations.  37  Emergency driver assistant facilitates emergency counteract measures if the driver falls asleep or does not perform any driving action after a defined length of time.  38  After a specified period of time if the driver has not interacted with the accelerator brake or steering wheel the car will send audio visual and physical signals to the driver.  38  If the driver does not wake up after these signals the system will stop safely position the vehicle away from oncoming traffic and turn on the hazard warning lights.  38  Hill descent control helps drivers maintain a safe speed when driving down a hill or other decline.  39  These systems are typically enacted if the vehicle moves faster than 15 to 20 mph when driving down. When a change in grade is sensed hill descent control automates the drivers speed to descend down the steep grade safely.  39  This system works by pulsing the braking system and controlling each wheel independently to maintain traction down the descent.  39  Hillstart assist also known as hillstart control or hill holder helps prevent a vehicle from rolling backward down a hill when starting again from a stopped position.  40  This feature holds the brake for you while you transition between the brake pedal and the gas pedal.  40  For manual cars this feature holds the brake for you while you transition between the brake pedal the clutch and the gas pedal.  40  Lane centering assists the driver in keeping the vehicle centered in a lane.  41  A lanecentering system may autonomously take over the steering when it determines the driver is at risk of deterring from the lane.  41  This system uses cameras to monitor lane markings to stay within a safe distance between both sides of the lane.  42  Lane change assistance helps the driver through a safe completion of a lane change by using sensors to scan the vehicles surroundings and monitor the drivers blind spots.  43  When a driver intends to make a lane change the vehicle will notify the driver through an audio or visual alert when a vehicle is approaching from behind or is in the vehicles blind spot.  43  The visual alert may appear in the dashboard headsupdisplay or the exterior rearview mirrors.  44  Several kind of lane change assistance might exist for instance UNECE regulation 79 considers  45  ACSF Automatically commanded steering function of Category C ... a function which is initiatedactivated by the driver and which can perform a single lateral manoeuvre e.g. lane change when commanded by the driver. ACSF of Category D ... a function which is initiatedactivated by the driver and which can indicate the possibility of a single lateral manoeuvre e.g. lane change but performs that function only following a confirmation by the driver. ACSF of Category E ... a function which is initiatedactivated by the driver and which can continuously determine the possibility of a manoeuvre e.g. lane change and complete these manoeuvres for extended periods without further driver commandconfirmation. Rain sensors detect water and automatically trigger electrical actions such as the raising of open windows and the closing of open convertible tops.  46  A rain sensor can also take in the frequency of rain droplets to automatically trigger windshield wipers with an accurate speed for the corresponding rainfall.  46  Traction control system TCS helps prevent traction loss in vehicles and prevent vehicle turnover on sharp curves and turns.  47  By limiting tire slip or when the force on a tire exceeds the tires traction this limits power delivery and helps the driver accelerate the car without losing control.  47  These systems use the same wheelspeed sensors as the antilock braking systems.  47  Individual wheel braking systems are deployed through TCS to control when one tire spins faster than the others.  47  Visual and environmental monitoring  edit  AutoHUD displayed on windshield Automotive night vision display Backup camera displayed in digital instrument panel Automotive headup display autoHUD safely displays essential system information to a driver at a vantage point that does not require the driver to look down or away from the road.  48  Currently the majority of the autoHUD systems on the market display system information on a windshield using LCDs.  48  Automotive navigation system use digital mapping tools such as the global positioning system GPS and traffic message channel TMC to provide drivers with up to date traffic and navigation information.  49  Through an embedded receiver an automotive navigation system can send and receive data signals transmitted from satellites regarding the current position of the vehicle in relation to its surroundings.  49  Automotive night vision systems enable the vehicle to detect obstacles including pedestrians in a nighttime setting or heavy weather situation when the driver has low visibility. These systems can various technologies including infrared sensors GPS Lidar and Radar to detect pedestrians and nonhuman obstacles.  49  Backup camera provides realtime video information regarding the location of your vehicle and its surroundings.  50  This camera offers drivers aid when backing up by providing a viewpoint that is typically a blind spot in traditional cars.  14  When the driver puts the car in reverse the camera automatically turns on.  14  Glarefree high beam use Light Emitting Diodes more commonly known as LEDs to cut two or more cars from the light distribution.  51  This allows oncoming vehicles coming in the opposite direction not to be affected by the light of the  highbeams. In 2010 the VW Touareg introduced the first glarefree high beam headlamp system which used a mechanical shutter to cut light from hitting specific traffic participants.  51  Omniview technology improves a drivers visibility by offering a 360degree viewing system.  52  This system can accurately provide 3D peripheral images of the cars surroundings through video display outputted to the driver.  52  Currently commercial systems can only provide 2D images of the drivers surroundings. Omniview technology uses the input of four cameras and a birds eye technology to provide a composite 3D model of the surroundings.  52  Traffic sign recognition TSR systems can recognize common traffic signs such as a stop sign or a turn ahead sign through image processing techniques.  53  This system takes into account the signs shape such as hexagons and rectangles and the color to classify what the sign is communicating to the driver.  53  Since most systems currently use camerabased technology a wide variety of factors can make the system less accurate. These include poor lighting conditions extreme weather conditions and partial obstruction of the sign.  53  Vehicular communication systems come in three forms vehicletovehicle V2V vehicletoinfrastructure V2I and vehicletoeverything V2X. V2V systems allow vehicles to exchange information with each other about their current position and upcoming hazards.  54  V2I systems occur when the vehicle exchanges information with nearby infrastructure elements such as street signs.  54  V2X systems occur when the vehicle monitors its environment and takes in information about possible obstacles or pedestrians in its path.  54  Handsoff systems  edit  Ford and General Motors provide handsoff eyeson systems such as Blue Cruise and Super Cruise in North America. These systems allow drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel while the system is engaged. However drivers must keep their eyes on the road and be ready to take immediate action at all times.

Updates on reimplementing the Graph extension which will be known as the Chart extension can be found on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org . In Europe in Q2 2018 3 of sold passenger cars had level 2 autonomy driving features. In Europe in Q2 2019 325000 passenger cars are sold with level 2 autonomy driving features that is 8 of all new cars sold.  58  According to a 2021 research report from Canalys approximately 33 percent of new vehicles sold in the United States Europe Japan and China had ADAS features. The firm also predicted that fifty percent of all automobiles on the road by the year 2030 would be ADASenabled.  5  Branding  edit  Major car brands with Level 2 features include Audi  BMW  MercedesBenz  Tesla  Volvo  Tata  Citroën  Ford  Hyundai  Kia  Mazda  Nissan  Peugeot  Mahindra and Subaru .  58  Full Level 2 features are included with Full SelfDriving from Tesla Pilot Assist from Volvo OpenPilot from Comma.ai and ProPILOT Assist from Nissan.  58  Level 3 features are included in Drive Pilot from MercedesBenz.  59  Crash statistics  edit  On June 29 2021 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA the branch of the United States Department of Transportation responsible for federal motor vehicle regulations issued Standing General Order 202101 SGO 202101  60  which required manufacturers of ADAS Levels 1 or 2 and Automated Driving Systems ADS Levels 3 through 5 to promptly report crashes that occurred when driverassistance or automation systems were in use.  61  SGO 202101 subsequently was amended on August 5 2021.  62  Under the amended SGO 202101 a crash involving ADS or Level 2 ADAS is reportable to the NHTSA if it meets the following criteria  62   1315 it happened on a publicly accessible road in the United States the Levels 35 ADS or Level 2 ADAS was engaged at any time within 30 seconds before the start of the crash through the conclusion of the crash A severe crash is one that results in one or more of the following  62   14 transport to a hospital for medical treatment or a fatality regardless of whether that person was an occupant of the vehicle equipped with the ADS or L2 ADAS a vehicle towaway or an air bag deployment regardless of whether that is the vehicle equipped with the ADS or L2 ADAS involves a vulnerable road user anyone who is not an occupant of a motor vehicle with more than three wheels typically pedestrians wheelchair users motorcyclists or bicyclists regardless of that vulnerable road users influence on the cause of the crash The incident report to the NHTSA must be made according to the following schedule  62   13 14 Severe crashes must be reported within one calendar day after the manufacturer receives notice the crash has occurred. In addition an updated crash incident report must be made within ten calendar days after the manufacturer receives notice the crash has occurred. Otherwise nonsevere crashes involving ADS excluding L2 ADAS must be reported on the fifteenth day of the month following the calendar month in which the manufacturer receives notice the crash has occurred. SGO 202101 is in effect for three years starting on June 29 2021.  62   9 After gathering data for almost a year July 1 2021 through May 15 2022 the NHTSA released the initial set of data in June 2022 and stated they plan to update the data on a monthly basis.  63  The data are subject to several caveats and limitations for instance manufacturers are not required to report the number of vehicles that have been built and equipped with ADSADAS the number of vehicles operating with ADSADAS or the total distance traveled with ADSADAS active which would be helpful to normalize the incident report data.  60  According to the initial data covering July 2021 to May 15 2022 ADS Levels 35 from 25 different manufacturers were involved in 130 crashes led by Waymo LLC 62 Transdev Alternative Services 34 Cruise LLC 23 General Motors 16 and Argo AI 10 because multiple manufacturers can report the same crash the sum exceeds the total number of reportable incidents.  64   45 Of the 130 crashes 108 had no associated injuries reported there was only one serious injury associated with the remaining crashes.  64   6 The most commonlyreported damage location was the rear of the ADSequipped vehicle.  64   7 Similarly ADAS Level 2 from 12 different manufacturers were involved in 367 crashes over the same period 392 crashes were reported in total but 25 either occurred before July 2021 or had no associated date. Reported incidents were led by Tesla 273 Honda 90 and Subaru 10.  65   56 Of the 392 crashes 98 included injury reporting of the 98 46 had no injuries reported 5 resulted in serious injuries and 6 resulted in fatalities.  65   7 The most commonlyreported damage location was the front of the ADASequipped vehicle.  65   8 Potential issues and concerns  edit  Need for standardization  edit  According to PACTS lack of full standardization might make the system have difficulty being understandable by the driver who might believe that the car behaves like another car while it does not.  66  We cant help feeling that this lack of standardisation is one of the more problematic aspects of driverassistance systems and its one that is likely to be felt more keenly as systems become increasingly commonplace in years to come particularly if traffic laws change to allow handsoff driving in the future.  EuroNCAP  67  ADAS might have many limitations for instance a precollision system might have 12 pages to explain 23 exceptions where ADAS may operate when not needed and 30 exceptions where ADAS may not operate when a collision is likely.  66  Adaptive cruise control display in the instrument panel of a Volkswagen Golf Mk7 Names for ADAS features are not standardized. For instance adaptive cruise control is called Adaptive Cruise Control by Fiat Ford GM VW Volvo and Peugeot but Intelligent Cruise Control by Nissan Active Cruise Control by Citroen and BMW and DISTRONIC by Mercedes.  66  To help with standardization SAE International has endorsed a series of recommendations for generic ADAS terminology for car manufacturers that it created with Consumer Reports  the American Automobile Association  J.D. Power  and the National Safety Council .  68   69  Buttons and dashboard symbols change from car to car due to lack of standardization.  66  ADAS behavior might change from car to car for instance ACC speed might be temporarily overridden in most cars while some switch to standby after one minute.  66  Insurance and economic impact  edit  The AV industry is growing exponentially and according to a report by Market Research Future the market is expected to hit over 65 billion by 2027. AV insurance and rising competition are expected to fuel that growth.  70  Auto insurance for ADAS has directly affected the global economy and many questions have arisen within the general public. ADAS allow autonomous vehicles to enable selfdriving features but there are associated risks with ADAS. AV companies and manufacturers are recommended to have insurance in the following areas in order to avoid any serious litigations. Depending on the level ranging from 0 to 5 each car manufacturer would find it in its best interest to find the right combination of different insurances to best match their products. Note that this list is not exhaustive and may be constantly updated with more types of insurances and risks in the years to come. Technology errors and omissions  This insurance will cover any physical risk if the technology itself has failed. These usually include all of the associated expenses of a car crash.  71  Auto liability and physical damage  This insurance covers thirdparty injuries and technology damage.  71  Cyber liability  This insurance will protect companies from any lawsuits from third parties and penalties from regulators regarding cybersecurity.  72  Directors and officers  This insurance protects a companys balance sheet and assets by protecting the company from bad management or misappropriation of assets.  72  With the technology embedded in autonomous vehicles these selfdriving cars are able to distribute data if a car crash occurs. This in turn will invigorate the claims administration and their operations. Fraud reduction will also disable any fraudulent staging of car crashes by recording the cars monitoring of every minute on the road.  73  ADAS are expected to streamline the insurance industry and its economic efficiency with capable technology to fight off fraudulent human behavior. In September 2016 the NHTSA published the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy which describes the U.S. Department of Transportations policies related to highly automated vehicles HAV which range from vehicles with ADAS features to autonomous vehicles . Ethical issues and current solutions  edit  See also Selfdriving car liability and Tesla Autopilot  Fatal crashes In March 2014 the US Department of Transportations National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA announced that it will require all new vehicles under 10000 pounds 4500 kg to have rear view cameras by May 2018. The rule was required by Congress as part of the Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act of 2007.  74  The Act is named after twoyearold Cameron Gulbransen. Camerons father backed up his SUV over him when he did not see the toddler in the familys driveway  75  The advancement of autonomous driving is accompanied by ethical concerns. The earliest moral issue associated with autonomous driving can be dated back to as early as the age of the trolleys. The trolley problem is one of the most wellknown ethical issues. Introduced by English philosopher Philippa Foot in 1967 the trolley problem asks that under a situation which the trolleys brake does not work and there are five people ahead of the trolley the driver may go straight killing the five persons ahead or turn to the side track killing the one pedestrian what should the driver do  76  Before the development of autonomous vehicles the trolley problem remains an ethical dilemma between utilitarianism and deontological ethics. However as the advancement in ADAS proceeds the trolley problem becomes an issue that needs to be addressed by the programming of selfdriving cars. The crashes that autonomous vehicles might face could be very similar to those depicted in the trolley problem.  77  Although ADAS make vehicles generally safer than only humandriven cars crashes are unavoidable.  77  This raises questions such as whose lives should be prioritized in the event of an inevitable crash Or What should be the universal principle for these crashalgorithms NTSB investigators examine the Volvo XC90 operated by Uber that struck and killed Elaine Herzberg 2018. Many researchers have been working on ways to address the ethical concerns associated with ADAS. For instance the artificial intelligence approach allows computers to learn human ethics by feeding them data regarding human actions.  78  Such a method is useful when the rules cannot be articulated because the computer can learn and identify the ethical elements on its own without precisely programming whether an action is ethical.  79  However there are limitations to this approach. For example many human actions are done out of selfpreservation instincts which is realistic but not ethical feeding such data to the computer cannot guarantee that the computer captures the ideal behavior.  80  Furthermore the data fed to an artificial intelligence must be carefully selected to avoid producing undesired outcomes.  80  Another notable method is a threephase approach proposed by Noah J. Goodall. This approach first necessitates a system established with the agreement of car manufacturers transportation engineers lawyers and ethicists and should be set transparently.  80  The second phase is letting artificial intelligence learn human ethics while being bound by the system established in phase one.  80  Lastly the system should provide constant feedback that is understandable by humans.  80  Ratings  edit  Consumer Reports  edit  In October 2023 Consumer Reports rated 17 active driving assistance systems.  81  Their criteria were  81  Capabilities and performance Clear when safe to use Ease of use Keeping the driver engaged Unresponsive driver Their ratings were  81  Rating Manufacturer System 84 FordLincoln BlueCruise 75 ChevroletGMCCadillac Super Cruise 72 MercedesBenz Driver Assistance 69 BMW Driving Assistance Professional 65 LexusToyota Safety System 3.0Safety Sense 3.0 63 NissanInfiniti ProPILOT Assist 2.0 62 VolkswagenAudi Travel AssistAdaptive Cruise Assist with lane guidance 61 Tesla Autopilot 59 Lucid Highway Assist 59 Rivian Highway Assist 59 HyundaiKiaGenesis Highway Driving Assist 2 59 Subaru Advanced Adaptive Cruise Control with Lane Centering Assist 58 NissanInfiniti ProPILOT Assist 58 HondaAcura SensingAcuraWatch 53 JaguarLand Rover Adaptive Cruise wSteer Assist 53 VolvoPolestar Pilot Assist 47 HyundaiKiaGenesis Highway Driving Assist Insurance Institute for Highway Safety  edit  In March 2024 the American Insurance Institute for Highway Safety IIHS reported its first partial automation safeguard ratings.  82  Their criteria were  83  Adaptive cruise control does not automatically resume after a lengthy stop or if the driver is not looking at the road Automated lane changes must be initiated or confirmed by the driver Automation features cannot be used with seat belt unfastened Automation features cannot be used with automatic emergency braking or lane departure preventionwarning disabled Failsafe procedure slows vehicle notifies manufacturer and keeps automation off limits for remainder of drive Lane centering does not discourage steering by driver Monitors both the drivers gaze and hand position Uses multiple types of rapidly escalating alerts to get drivers attention The ratings were no system received a good rating  83  Rating Manufacturer System Acceptable Lexus Teammate with Advanced Drive Marginal General Motors Super Cruise Marginal Nissan ProPILOT Assist with Navilink Poor BMW Active Driving Assistant Pro Poor Ford BlueCruise Poor Ford Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop  Go and Lane Centering Assist Poor Genesis Highway Driving Assist 2 Poor Genesis Smart Cruise ControlLane Following Assist Poor Lexus Dynamic Radar Cruise Control with Lane Tracing Assist Poor MercedesBenz Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC with Active Steering Assist Poor Nissan ProPILOT Assist 2.0 Poor Tesla Autopilot  Version 2023.7.10 Poor Tesla Full SelfDriving Beta Version 2023.7.10 Poor Volvo Pilot Assist Future  edit  Intelligent transport systems ITS highly resemble ADAS but experts believe that ITS goes beyond automatic traffic to include any enterprise that safely transports humans.  80  ITS is where the transportation technology is integrated with a citys infrastructure.  84  This would then lead to a smart city.  84  These systems promote active safety by increasing the efficiency of roads possibly by adding 22.5 capacity on average not the actual count.  84  ADAS have aided in this increase in active safety according to a study in 2008. ITS systems use a wide system of communication technology including wireless technology and traditional technology to enhance productivity.  80  Driver control assistance systems DCAS is the name of a draft ADAS regulation.  85  It would allow handsfree driving with a possible risk of lack of attentiveness.  86  Such DCAS regulation would allow system such as Tesla FSD in Europe.  87  The UNECE driver control assistance systems regulation plan that DCAS shall be designed to ensure that the driver performs the driving task that the drivers hands must remain on the wheel and that the system shall monitor the drivers visual engagement.  88  See also  edit  Mobileye Applied Intuition EuroFOT Road Safety Integrated VehicleBased Safety Systems Intelligent transportation system Handsfree driving Traffic psychology Automotive electronics References  edit   Epstein Zach 20160721.
