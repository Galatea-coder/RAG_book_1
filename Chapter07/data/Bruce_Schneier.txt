Schneier is an Adjunct Lecturer in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School  2  and a Fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet  Society as of November 2013.  3  He is a board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation  Access Now  and The Tor Project  and an advisory board member of Electronic Privacy Information Center and VerifiedVoting.org . He is the author of several books on general security topics computer security and cryptography and is a squid enthusiast.  4  In 2015 Schneier received the EPIC Lifetime Achievement Award from Electronic Privacy Information Center.  5  Early life and education  edit  Bruce Schneier is the son of Martin Schneier a Brooklyn Supreme Court judge. He grew up in the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn New York  attending P.S. 139 and Hunter College High School .  6  After receiving a physics bachelors degree from the University of Rochester in 1984  7  he went to American University in Washington D.C.  and got his masters degree in computer science in 1988.  8  He was awarded an honorary Ph.D from the University of Westminster in London England  in November 2011. The award was made by the Department of Electronics and Computer Science in recognition of Schneiers hard work and contribution to industry and public life. Schneier was a founder and chief technology officer of Counterpane Internet Security now BT Managed Security Solutions .  He worked for IBM once they acquired Resilient Systems where Schneier was CTO  9   10   11  until he left at the end of June 2019.  12  Writings on computer security and general security  edit  In 1991 Schneier was laid off from his job and started writing for computer magazines. Later he decided to write a book on applied cryptography since no such book existed. He took his articles wrote a proposal to John Wiley and they bought the proposal.  13  In 1994 Schneier published Applied Cryptography  which details the design use and implementation of cryptographic algorithms. This book allowed me to write more to start consulting to start my companies and really launched me as an expert in this field and it really was because no one else has written this book. I wanted to read it so I had to write it. And it happened in a really lucky time when everything started to explode on the Internet.  13  In 2010 he published Cryptography Engineering  which is focused more on how to use cryptography in real systems and less on its internal design. He has also written books on security for a broader audience. In 2000 Schneier published Secrets and Lies Digital Security in a Networked World  in 2003 Beyond Fear Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World  in 2012 Liars and Outliers Enabling the Trust that Society Needs to Thrive  and in 2015 Data and Goliath The Hidden Battles to Collect Your Data and Control Your World .  14  Schneier writes a freely available monthly Internet newsletter on computer and other security issues CryptoGram  as well as a security weblog  Schneier on Security .  15  The blog focuses on the latest threats and his own thoughts. The weblog started out as a way to publish essays before they appeared in CryptoGram making it possible for others to comment on them while the stories were still current but over time the newsletter became a monthly email version of the blog reedited and reorganized.  16   citation needed  Schneier is frequently quoted in the press on computer and other security issues pointing out flaws in security and cryptographic implementations ranging from biometrics to airline security after the September 11 attacks .  17  Viewpoints  edit  Blockchains  edit  Schneier warns about misplaced trust in blockchain  18  and the lack of use cases calling blockchain a solution in search of a problem.  19  What blockchain does is shift some of the trust in people and institutions to trust in technology. You need to trust the cryptography the protocols the software the computers and the network. And you need to trust them absolutely because theyre often single points of failure. Ive never seen a legitimate use case for blockchain. Ive never seen any system where blockchain provides security in a way that is impossible to provide in any other way.  20  He goes on to say that cryptocurrencies are useless and are only used by speculators looking for quick riches. Cryptography  edit  To Schneier peer review and expert analysis are important for the security of cryptographic systems.  21  Mathematical cryptography is usually not the weakest link in a security chain effective security requires that cryptography be combined with other things.  22  The term Schneiers law was coined by Cory Doctorow in a 2004 speech.  23  The law is phrased as Any person can invent a security system so clever that she or he cant think of how to break it. He attributes this to Bruce Schneier who wrote in 1998 Anyone from the most clueless amateur to the best cryptographer can create an algorithm that he himself cant break. Its not even hard. What is hard is creating an algorithm that no one else can break even after years of analysis.  24  Similar sentiments had been expressed by others before. In The Codebreakers  David Kahn states Few false ideas have more firmly gripped the minds of so many intelligent men than the one that if they just tried they could invent a cipher that no one could break and in A Few Words On Secret Writing in July 1841 Edgar Allan Poe had stated Few persons can be made to believe that it is not quite an easy thing to invent a method of secret writing which shall baffle investigation. Yet it may be roundly asserted that human ingenuity cannot concoct a cipher which human ingenuity cannot resolve.  25  Schneier also coined the term kid sister cryptography writing in the Preface to Applied Cryptography  26  that There are two kinds of cryptography in this world cryptography that will stop your kid sister from reading your files and cryptography that will stop major governments from reading your files. This book is about the latter. Digital rights management  edit  Schneier is critical of digital rights management DRM and has said that it allows a vendor to increase lockin .  27  Proper implementation of controlbased security for the user via trusted computing is very difficult and security is not the same thing as control.  27  Schneier insists that owning your data is a different way of thinking about data.  28  Full disclosure  edit  Schneier is a proponent of full disclosure  i.e. making security issues public. If researchers dont go public things dont get fixed. Companies dont see it as a security problem they see it as a PR problem.  29  Homeland security  edit  Schneier has said that homeland security money should be spent on intelligence  investigation and emergency response .  30  Defending against the broad threat of terrorism is generally better than focusing on specific potential terrorist plots.  30  According to Schneier analysis of intelligence data is difficult but is one of the better ways to deal with global terrorism.  31  Human intelligence has advantages over automated and computerized analysis and increasing the amount of intelligence data that is gathered does not help to improve the analysis process.  31  Agencies that were designed around fighting the Cold War may have a culture that inhibits the sharing of information the practice of sharing information is more important and less of a security threat in itself when dealing with more decentralized and poorly funded adversaries such as al Qaeda.  32  Regarding PETN the explosive that has become terrorists weapon of choiceSchneier has written that only swabs and dogs can detect it. He also believes that changes to airport security since 11 September 2001 have done more harm than good and he defeated Kip Hawley  former head of the Transportation Security Administration in an Economist online debate by 87 to 13 regarding the issue.  33  He is widely credited with coining the term  security theater  to describe some such changes. As a Fellow of Berkman Center for Internet  Society at Harvard University  Schneier is exploring the intersection of security technology and people with an emphasis on power.  34  Movie plot threat  edit  Movieplot threat is a term Schneier coined that refers to very specific and dramatic terrorist attack scenarios reminiscent of the behavior of terrorists in movies rather than what terrorists actually do in the real world.  35  Security measures created to protect against movie plot threats do not provide a higher level of real security because such preparation only pays off if terrorists choose that one particular avenue of attack which may not even be feasible. Realworld terrorists would also be likely to notice the highly specific security measures and simply attack in some other way. The specificity of movie plot threats gives them power in the public imagination however so even extremely unrealistic security theater countermeasures may receive strong support from the public and legislators. Among many other examples of movie plot threats Schneier described banning baby carriers from subways  for fear that they may contain explosives.  36  Starting in April 2006 Schneier has had an annual contest to create the most fantastic movieplot threat.  37  In 2015 during the 8th and as of 17 February 2022 update the last one he mentioned that the contest may have run its course.  38  System design  edit  Schneier has criticized security approaches that try to prevent any malicious incursion instead arguing that designing systems to fail well is more important.  39  The designer of a system should not underestimate the capabilities of an attacker as technology may make it possible in the future to do things that are not possible at the present.  21  Under Kerckhoffss Principle  the need for one or more parts of a cryptographic system to remain secret increases the fragility of the system whether details about a system should be obscured depends upon the availability of persons who can make use of the information for beneficial uses versus the potential for attackers to misuse the information.  40  Secrecy and security arent the same even though it may seem that way. Only bad security relies on secrecy good security works even if all the details of it are public.  41  Cryptographic algorithms  edit  Schneier has been involved in the creation of many cryptographic algorithms.
