Lampson born December 23 1943 is an American computer scientist best known for his contributions to the development and implementation of distributed personal computing . Education and early life  edit  After graduating from the Lawrenceville School where in 2009 he was awarded the Aldo Leopold Award also known as the Lawrenceville Medal Lawrencevilles highest award to alumni Lampson received an A.B. in physics  magna cum laude with highest honors in the discipline from Harvard University in 1964 and a PhD in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California Berkeley in 1967. Career and research  edit  Professional Developers Conference 2009 Technical Leaders Panel During the 1960s Lampson and others were part of Project GENIE at UC Berkeley. In 1965 several Project GENIE members specifically Lampson and Peter Deutsch  developed the Berkeley Timesharing System for Scientific Data Systems  SDS 940 computer. After completing his doctorate Lampson stayed on at UC Berkeley as an assistant professor 19671970 and associate professor 19701971 of computer science. For a period of time he concurrently served as director of system development for the Berkeley Computer Corporation 19691971. In 1971 Lampson became one of the founding members of Xerox PARC  where he worked in the Computer Science Laboratory CSL as a principal scientist 19711975 and senior research fellow 19751983. His nowfamous vision of a personal computer was captured in the 1972 memo entitled Why Alto.  1  In 1973 the Xerox Alto  with its threebutton mouse and fullpagesized monitor  was born.  2  It is now considered to be the first actual personal computer in terms of what has become the canonical GUI mode of operation. All the subsequent computers built at Xerox PARC except for the Dolphin used in the Xerox 1100 LISP machine and the Dorado used in the Xerox 1132 LISP machine followed a general blueprint called Wildflower written by Lampson and this included the DSeries Machines the Dandelion used in the Xerox Star and Xerox 1108 LISP machine Dandetiger used in the Xerox 1109 LISP machine Daybreak  Xerox 6085  and Dicentra used internally to control various specialized hardware devices. At PARC Lampson helped work on many other revolutionary technologies such as laser printer design twophase commit protocols  Bravo  the first WYSIWYG text formatting program and Ethernet  the first highspeed local area network LAN.  He designed several influential programming languages such as Euclid . Following the acrimonious resignation of Xerox PARC CSL manager Bob Taylor in 1983 Lampson and Chuck Thacker followed Taylor colleague to Digital Equipment Corporation s Systems Research Center . There he was a senior consulting engineer 19841986 corporate consulting engineer 19861993 and senior corporate consulting engineer 19931995. Shortly before Taylors retirement Lampson left to work for Microsoft Research as an architect 19951999 distinguished engineer 20002005 and technical fellow 2005present. Since 1987 Lampson has been an adjunct professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Honors and awards  edit  In 1984 he was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering . In 1984 he won the ACM Software System Award for the Alto  along with Robert W. Taylor  and Charles P. Thacker . In 1986 he received an honorary Sc.D. from the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich. In 1992 he won the prestigious ACM Turing Award for his contributions to personal computing and computer science .  3  In 1993 he became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the ACM . In 1996 he received the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award . In 1996 he received an honorary Sc.D. from the University of Bologna. In 2001 he received the IEEE John von Neumann Medal .  4  In 2004 he won the Charles Stark Draper Prize along with Alan C. Kay  Robert W. Taylor  and Charles P. Thacker for their work on Alto .  5  In 2005 he was elected a Member of the National Academy of Sciences .  6  In 2006 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Computer History Museum for fundamental contributions to computer science including networked personal workstations operating systems computer security and document publishing. Computer History Museum Fellow 2006.  7  In 2006 he received the IFIP TC11 Kristian Beckman Award for information security. In 2016 he was inducted into the National Cyber Security Hall of Fame . In 2018 he was elected as a Foreign Member of the Royal Society . Quotes  edit  Lampson is often quoted as saying  Any problem in computer science can be solved with another level of indirection  but in his Turing Award Lecture in 1993 Lampson himself attributes this saying to David Wheeler .  8  References  edit   DigiBarn Computer Museum Why Alto Butler Lampsons Historic 1972 Memo  Thacker C.P.
