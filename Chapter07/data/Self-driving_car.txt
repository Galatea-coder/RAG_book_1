In December 2020 Waymo was the first to offer rides in selfdriving taxis to the public in limited geographic areas  SAE Level 4   7   failed verification  and as of April 2024 update offers services in Arizona Phoenix and California San Francisco and Los Angeles. In June 2024 after a Waymo selfdriving taxi crashed into a utility pole in Phoenix Arizona   all 672 of its Jaguar IPace were recalled after they were found to have susceptibility to crashing into pole like items and had their software updated.  8   9   10  In July 2021 DeepRoute.ai started offering selfdriving taxi rides in Shenzhen China. Starting in February 2022 Cruise offered selfdriving taxi service in San Francisco  11  but suspended service in 2023. In 2021 Honda was the first manufacturer to sell an SAE Level 3 car  12   13   14  followed by MercedesBenz in 2023.  15  A Waymo operated Jaguar IPace in San Francisco 2023. This model was recalled after a crash into a pole.  9  Roborace autonomous racing car on display at the 2017 New York City ePrix Baidu selfdriving car History  edit  Main article History of selfdriving cars Experiments have been conducted on advanced driver assistance systems ADAS since at least the 1920s.  16  The first ADAS system was cruise control  which was invented in 1948 by Ralph Teetor . Trials began in the 1950s. The first semiautonomous car was developed in 1977 by Japans Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory.  17  It required specially marked streets that were interpreted by two cameras on the vehicle and an analog computer. The vehicle reached speeds of 30 kmh 19 mph with the support of an elevated rail.  18   19  Carnegie Mellon University s Navlab  20  and ALV  21   22  semiautonomous projects launched in the 1980s funded by the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA starting in 1984 and MercedesBenz and Bundeswehr University Munich s EUREKA Prometheus Project in 1987.  23  By 1985 ALV had reached 31 kmh 19 mph on twolane roads. Obstacle avoidance came in 1986 and day and night offroad driving by 1987.  24  In 1995 Navlab 5 completed the first autonomous US coasttocoast journey. Traveling from Pittsburgh  Pennsylvania and San Diego California 98.2 of the trip was autonomous. It completed the trip at an average speed of 63.8 mph 102.7 kmh.  25   26   27   28  Until the second DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005 automated vehicle research in the United States was primarily funded by DARPA the US Army and the US Navy yielding incremental advances in speeds driving competence controls and sensor systems.  29  The US allocated US650 million in 1991 for research on the National Automated Highway System  30  which demonstrated automated driving combining highwayembedded automation with vehicle technology and cooperative networking between the vehicles and highway infrastructure. The programme concluded with a successful demonstration in 1997.  31  Partly funded by the National Automated Highway System and DARPA Navlab drove 4584 km 2848 mi across the US in 1995 4501 km 2797 mi or 98 autonomously.  32  In 2015 Delphi piloted a Delphi technologybased Audi over 5472 km 3400 mi through 15 states 99 autonomously.  33  In 2015 Nevada  Florida California Virginia  Michigan  and Washington DC allowed autonomous car testing on public roads.  34  From 2016 to 2018 the European Commission funded development for connected and automated driving through Coordination Actions CARTRE and SCOUT programs.  35  The Strategic Transport Research and Innovation Agenda STRIA Roadmap for Connected and Automated Transport was published in 2019.  36  In November 2017 Waymo announced testing of autonomous cars without a safety driver.  37  However an employee was in the car to handle emergencies.  38  In March 2018 Elaine Herzberg became the first reported pedestrian killed by a selfdriving car an Uber test vehicle with a human backup driver prosecutors did not charge Uber while the human driver was sentenced to probation.  39  In December 2018 Waymo was the first to commercialize a robotaxi service in Phoenix Arizona.  40  In October 2020 Waymo launched a robotaxi service in a  geofenced  part of the area.  41   42  The cars were monitored in realtime and remote engineers intervened to handle exceptional conditions.  43   42  In March 2019 ahead of Roborace  Robocar set the Guinness World Record as the worlds fastest autonomous car. Robocar reached 282.42 kmh 175.49 mph.  44  In March 2021 Honda began leasing in Japan a limited edition of 100 Legend Hybrid EX sedans equipped with Level 3 Traffic Jam Pilot driving technology which legally allowed drivers to take their eyes off the road when the car was travelling under 30 kilometres per hour 19 mph.  12   13   45   14  In December 2020 Waymo became the first service provider to offer driverless taxi rides to the general public in a part of Phoenix Arizona . Nuro began autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in 2021.  46  DeepRoute.ai launched robotaxi service in Shenzhen in July 2021.  47  In December 2021 MercedesBenz received approval for a Level 3 car.  48  In February 2022 Cruise became the second service provider to offer driverless taxi rides to the general public in San Francisco .  11  In December 2022 several manufacturers scaled back plans for selfdriving technology including Ford and Volkswagen .  49  In 2023 Cruise suspended its robotaxi service.  50  Nuro was approved for Level 4 in Palo Alto in August 2023.  51  As of August 2023 update  vehicles operating at Level 3 and above were an insignificant market factor   citation needed  as of early 2024 Honda leases a Level 3 car in Japan and Mercedes sells two Level 3 cars in Germany California and Nevada.  52   53  Definitions  edit  Organizations such as SAE have proposed terminology standards. However most terms have no standard definition and are employed variously by vendors and others. Proposals to adopt aviation automation terminology for cars have not prevailed.  54  Names such as AutonoDrive PilotAssist FullSelf Driving or DrivePilot are used even though the products offer an assortment of features that may not match the names.  55  Despite offering a system it called Full SelfDriving  Tesla stated that its system did not autonomously handle all driving tasks.  56  In the United Kingdom a fully selfdriving car is defined as a car so registered rather than one that supports a specific feature set.  57  The Association of British Insurers claimed that the usage of the word autonomous in marketing was dangerous because car ads make motorists think autonomous and autopilot imply that the driver can rely on the car to control itself even though they do not. Automated driving system  edit  SAE identified 6 levels for driving automation from level 0 to level 5.  58  An ADS is an SAE J3016 level 3 or higher system. Advanced driver assistance system  edit  Main article Advanced driverassistance system An ADAS is a system that automates specific driving features such as Forward Collision Warning FCW Automatic Emergency Braking AEB Lane Departure Warning LDW Lane Keeping Assistance LKA or Blind Spot Warning BSW.  59  An ADAS requires a human driver to handle tasks that the ADAS does not support. Autonomy versus automation  edit  Autonomy implies that an automation system is under the control of the vehicle rather than a driver. Automation is functionspecific handling issues such as speed control but leaves broader decisionmaking to the driver.  60  Euro NCAP defined autonomous as the system acts independently of the driver to avoid or mitigate the accident.  61  In Europe the words automated and autonomous can be used together. For instance Regulation EU 20192144 supplied  62  automated vehicle means a vehicle that can move without continuous driver supervision but that driver intervention is still expected or required in the operational design domains ODD  62  fully automated vehicle means a vehicle that can move entirely without driver supervision  62  Cooperative system  edit  A remote driver is a driver that operates a vehicle at a distance using a video and data connection.  63  According to SAE J3016  Some driving automation systems may indeed be autonomous if they perform all of their functions independently and selfsufficiently but if they depend on communication andor cooperation with outside entities they should be considered cooperative rather than autonomous. Operational design domain  edit  This section is an excerpt from Operational design domain .  edit  Part of a series on Automation Automation in general Banking Building Home Highway system Laboratory Library Broadcast Mix Pool cleaner Pop music Reasoning Semiautomation Telephone Attendant Switchboard Teller machine Vehicular Vending machine Robotics and robots Domestic Vacuum cleaner Roomba Lawn mower Guided vehicle Industrial Paint ODD Impact of automation Manumation OOL Bias Selfdriving cars Technological unemployment Jobless recovery Postwork society Threat Trade shows and awards ASPDAC DAC DATE IEEE Robotics and Automation Award ICCAD v t e Operational design domain ODD is a term for a particular operating context for an automated system often used in the field of autonomous vehicles . The context is defined by a set of conditions including environmental geographical time of day and other conditions. For vehicles traffic and roadway characteristics are included. Manufacturers use ODD to indicate wherehow their product operates safely. A given system may operate differently according to the immediate ODD.  64  The concept presumes that automated systems have limitations.  65  Relating system function to the ODD it supports is important for developers and regulators to establish and communicate safe operating conditions. Systems should operate within those limitations. Some systems recognize the ODD and modify their behavior accordingly. For example an autonomous car might recognize that traffic is heavy and disable its automated lane change feature.  65  Vendors have taken a variety of approaches to the selfdriving problem. Teslas approach is to allow their full selfdriving FSD system to be used in all ODDs as a Level 2 handson eyeson ADAS.  66  Waymo picked specific ODDs city streets in Phoenix and San Francisco for their Level 5 robotaxi service.  67  Mercedes Benz offers Level 3 service in Las Vegas in highway traffic jams at speeds up to 40 miles per hour 64 kmh.  68  Mobileyes SuperVision system offers handsoffeyeson driving on all road types at speeds up to 130 kilometres per hour 81 mph.  69  GMs handsfree Super Cruise operates on specific roads in specific conditions stopping or returning control to the driver when ODD changes. In 2024 the company announced plans to expand road coverage from 400000 miles to 750000 miles.  70  Fords BlueCruise handsoff system operates on 130000 miles of US divided highways.  71  Selfdriving  edit  The Union of Concerned Scientists defined selfdriving as cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or driverless cars they combine sensors and software to control navigate and drive the vehicle.  72  The British Automated and Electric Vehicles Act 2018 law defines a vehicle as driving itself if the vehicle is not being controlled and does not need to be monitored by an individual.  73  Another British government definition stated Selfdriving vehicles are vehicles that can safely and lawfully drive themselves.  74  British definitions  edit  In British English the word automated alone has several meanings such as in the sentence Thatcham also found that the automated lane keeping systems could only meet two out of the twelve principles required to guarantee safety going on to say they cannot therefore be classed as automated driving preferring assisted driving.  75  The first occurrence of the automated word refers to an Unece automated system while the second refers to the British legal definition of an automated vehicle. British law interprets the meaning of automated vehicle based on the interpretation section related to a vehicle driving itself and an insured vehicle.  76  In November 2023 the British Government introduced the Automated Vehicles Bill. It proposed definitions for related terms  77  Selfdriving A vehicle satisfies the selfdriving test if it is designed or adapted with the intention that a feature of the vehicle will allow it to travel autonomously and it is capable of doing so by means of that feature safely and legally. Autonomy A vehicle travels autonomously if it is controlled by the vehicle and neither the vehicle nor its surroundings are monitored by a person who can intervene. Control control of vehicle motion. Safe a vehicle that conforms to an acceptably safe standard. Legal a vehicle that offers an acceptably low risk of committing a traffic infraction. SAE classification  edit  Tesla Autopilot is classified as an SAE Level 2 system.  78   79  A sixlevel classification system  ranging from fully manual to fully automated  was published in 2014 by SAE International as J3016 Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to OnRoad Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems  the details are revised occasionally.  80  This classification is based on the role of the driver rather than the vehicles capabilities although these are related. After SAE updated its classification in 2016 J3016_201609  81  the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA adopted the SAE standard.  82   83  The classification is a topic of debate with various revisions proposed.  84   85  Classifications  edit  A driving mode aka driving scenario  combines an ODD with matched driving requirements e.g. expressway merging traffic jam.  1   86  Cars may switch levels in accord with the driving mode. Above Level 1 level differences are related to how responsibility for safe movement is dividedshared between ADAS and driver rather than specific driving features. J3016 Automation Levels  86  Level Name Narrative Responsibility for Mode coverage Vehicle direction  speed Monitoring environment Fallback 0 No Automation Fulltime performance by the driver of all aspects of driving even when enhanced by warning or intervention systems Driver Driver Driver na 1 Driver Assistance Driving modespecific control by an ADAS of either steering or speed ADAS uses information about the driving environment driver is expected to performs all other driving tasks. Driver and system Some 2 Partial Automation Driving modespecific execution by one or more ADAS for both steering and speed System 3 Conditional Automation Driving modespecific control by an ADAS of all aspects of driving Driver must appropriately respond to a request to intervene. System 4 High Automation If a driver does not respond appropriately to a request to intervene the car can stop safely. System Many 5 Full Automation System controls the vehicle under all conditions. All SAE Automation Levels have been criticized  by whom  for their technological focus. It has been argued that the structure of the levels suggests that automation increases linearly and that more automation is better which may not be the case.  87  SAE Levels also do not account for changes that may be required to infrastructure  88  and road user behavior.  89   90  Mobileye System  edit  Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua and CTO Shai ShalevShwartz proposed an alternative taxonomy for autonomous driving systems claiming that a more consumerfriendly approach was needed. Its categories reflect the amount of driver engagement that is required.  91   92  Some vehicle makers have informally adopted some of the terminology involved while not formally committing to it.  93   94   95   96  Eyesonhandson  edit  The first level handsoneyeson implies that the driver is fully engaged in operating the vehicle but is supervised by the system which intervenes according to the features it supports e.g. adaptive cruise control automatic emergency braking. The driver is entirely responsible with hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.  92  Eyesonhandsoff  edit  Eyesonhandsoff allows the driver to let go of the wheel. The system drives the driver monitors and remains prepared to resume control as needed.  92  Eyesoffhandsoff  edit  Eyesoffhandsoff means that the driver can stop monitoring the system leaving the system in full control.  Eyesoff requires that no errors be reproducible not triggered by exotic transitory conditions or frequent that speeds are contextually appropriate e.g. 80 mph on limitedaccess roads and that the system handle typical maneuvers e.g. getting cut off by another vehicle. The automation level could vary according to the road e.g. eyesoff on freeways eyeson on side streets.  92  No driver  edit  The highest level does not require a human driver in the car monitoring is done either remotely telepresence or not at all.  92  Safety  edit  A critical requirement for the higher two levels is that the vehicle be able to conduct a Minimum Risk Maneuver and stop safely out of traffic without driver intervention.  92  Technology  edit  Main article Vehicular automation Architecture  edit  The perception system processes visual and audio data from outside and inside the car to create a local model of the vehicle the road traffic traffic controls and other observable objects and their relative motion. The control system then takes actions to move the vehicle considering the local model road map and driving regulations.  97   98   99   100  Several classifications have been proposed to describe ADAS technology. One proposal is to adopt these categories navigation path planning perception and car control.  101  Navigation  edit  Main article Hybrid navigation Navigation involves the use of maps to define a path between origin and destination. Hybrid navigation is the use of multiple navigation systems . Some systems use basic maps relying on perception to deal with anomalies. Such a map understands which roads lead to which others whether a road is a freeway a highway are oneway etc. Other systems require highly detailed maps including lane maps obstacles traffic controls etc. Perception  edit  ACs need to be able to perceive the world around them. Supporting technologies include combinations of cameras LiDAR  radar  audio and ultrasound   102  GPS  and inertial measurement .  103   104   105  Deep neural networks are used to analyse inputs from these sensors to detect and identify objects and their trajectories.  106  Some systems use Bayesian simultaneous localization and mapping SLAM algorithms. Another technique is detection and tracking of other moving objects DATMO used to handle potential obstacles.  107   108  Other systems use roadside realtime locating system RTLS technologies to aid localization. Teslas vision only system uses eight cameras without LIDAR or radar to create its birdseye view of the environment.  109  Path planning  edit  Path planning finds a sequence of segments that a vehicle can use to move from origin to destination. Techniques used for path planning include graphbased search and variationalbased optimization techniques. Graphbased techniques can make harder decisions such as how to pass another vehicleobstacle. Variationalbased optimization techniques require more stringent restrictions on the vehicles path to prevent collisions.  110  The large scale path of the vehicle can be determined by using a voronoi diagram  an occupancy grid mapping  or a driving corridor algorithm. The latter allows the vehicle to locate and drive within open space that is bounded by lanes or barriers.  111  Maps  edit  Maps are necessary for navigation. Map sophistication varies from simple graphs that show which roads connect to each other with details such as oneway vs twoway to those that are highly detailed with information about lanes traffic controls roadworks and more.  102  Researchers at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory CSAIL developed a system called MapLite which allows selfdriving cars to drive with simple maps. The system combines the GPS position of the vehicle a sparse topological map such as OpenStreetMap which has only 2D road features with sensors that observe road conditions.  112  One issue with highlydetailed maps is updating them as the world changes. Vehicles that can operate with lessdetailed maps do not require frequent updates or geofencing. Sensors  edit  Sensors are necessary for the vehicle to properly respond to the driving environment. Sensor types include cameras LiDAR  ultrasound  and radar . Control systems typically combine data from multiple sensors .  113  Multiple sensors can provide a more complete view of the surroundings and can be used to crosscheck each other to correct errors.  114  For example radar can image a scene in e.g. a nighttime snowstorm that defeats cameras and LiDAR albeit at reduced precision. After experimenting with radar and ultrasound Tesla adopted a visiononly approach asserting that humans drive using only vision and that cars should be able to do the same while citing the lower cost of cameras versus other sensor types.  115  By contrast Waymo makes use of the higher resolution of LiDAR sensors and cites the declining cost of that technology.  116  Drive by wire  edit  Main article Drive by wire Drive by wire is the use of electrical or electromechanical systems for performing vehicle functions such as steering or speed control that are traditionally achieved by mechanical linkages. Driver monitoring  edit  Main article Driver monitoring system Driver monitoring is used to assess the drivers attention and alertness. Techniques in use include eye monitoring and requiring the driver to maintain torque on the steering wheel.  117  It attempts to understand driver status and identify dangerous driving behaviors.  118  Vehicle communication  edit  Main article Vehicular communication systems Vehicles can potentially benefit from communicating with others to share information about traffic road obstacles to receive map and software updates etc.  119   120   102  ISO TC 22 specifies invehicle transport information and control systems  121  while ISOTC 204 specifies information communication and control systems in surface transport.  122  International standards have been developed for ADAS functions connectivity human interaction invehicle systems managementengineering dynamic map and positioning privacy and security.  123  Rather than communicating among vehicles they can communicate with roadbased systems to receive similar information. Software update  edit  See also Overtheair programming Software controls the vehicle and can provide entertainment and other services. Overtheair updates can deliver bug fixes and additional features over the internet. Software updates are one way to accomplish recalls that in the past required a visit to a service center. In March 2021 the UNECE regulation on software update and software update management systems was published.  124  Safety model  edit  A safety model is software that attempts to formalize rules that ensure that ACs operate safely.  125  IEEE is attempting to forge a standard for safety models as IEEE P2846 A Formal Model for Safety Considerations in Automated Vehicle Decision Making.  126  In 2022 a research group at National Institute of Informatics NII Japan enhanced Mobileyes Reliable Safety System as GoalAware RSS to enable RSS rules to deal with complex scenarios via program logic.  127  Notification  edit  The US has standardized the use of turquoise lights to inform other drivers that a vehicle is driving autonomously. It will be used in the 2026 MercedesBenz EQS and SClass sedans with Drive Pilot an SAE Level 3 driving system.  citation needed  As of 2023 the Turquoise light had not been standardized by the P.R.C or the UNECE.  128  Artificial Intelligence  edit  Artificial intelligence AI plays a pivotal role in the development and operation of autonomous vehicles AVs enabling them to perceive their surroundings make decisions and navigate safely without human intervention. AI algorithms empower AVs to interpret sensory data from various onboard sensors such as cameras LiDAR radar and GPS to understand their environment and improve its technological ability and overall safety over time.  129  Challenges  edit  Autonomous delivery vehicles stuck in one place by attempting to avoid one another Obstacles  edit  The primary obstacle to ACs is the advanced software and mapping required to make them work safely across the wide variety of conditions that drivers experience.  130  In addition to handling daynight driving in good and bad weather  131  on roads of arbitrary quality ACs must cope with other vehicles road obstacles poormissing traffic controls flawed maps and handle endless edge cases such as following the instructions of a police officer managing traffic at a crash site. Other obstacles include cost liability  132   133  consumer reluctance  134  ethical dilemmas  135   136  security  137   138   139   140  privacy  131  and legalregulatory framework.  141  Further AVs could automate the work of professional drivers eliminating many jobs which could slow acceptance.  142  Concerns  edit  Deceptive marketing  edit  Tesla calls its Level 2 ADAS Full SelfDriving FSD Beta.  143  US Senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey called on the Federal Trade Commission FTC to investigate this marketing in 2021.  144  In December 2021 in Japan MercedesBenz was punished by the Consumer Affairs Agency for misleading product descriptions.  145  MercedesBenz was criticized for a misleading US commercial advertising EClass models .  146  At that time MercedesBenz rejected the claims and stopped its selfdriving car ad campaign that had been running.  147   148  In August 2022 the California Department of Motor Vehicles DMV accused Tesla of deceptive marketing practices.  149  With the Automated Vehicles Bill AVB selfdriving carmakers could face prison for misleading adverts in the UnitedKingdom.  150  Security  edit  In the 2020s concerns over ACs vulnerability to cyberattacks and data theft emerged.  151  Espionage  edit  In 2018 and 2019 former Apple engineers were charged with stealing information related to Apples selfdriving car project.  152   153   154  In 2021 the United States Department of Justice DOJ accused Chinese security officials of coordinating a hacking campaign to steal information from government entities including research related to autonomous vehicles.  155   156  China has prepared the Provisions on Management of Automotive Data Security Trial to protect its own data.  157   158  Cellular VehicletoEverything technologies are based on 5G wireless networks .  159  As of November 2022 update  the US Congress was considering the possibility that imported Chinese AC technology could facilitate espionage.  160  Testing of Chinese automated cars in the US has raised concern over which US data are collected by Chinese vehicles to be stored in Chinese country and concern with any link with the Chinese communist party.  161  Driver communications  edit  ACs complicate the need for drivers to communicate with each other e.g. to decide which car enters an intersection first. In an AC without a driver traditional means such as hand signals do not work no driver no hands.  162  Behavior prediction  edit  ACs must be able to predict the behavior of possibly moving vehicles pedestrians etc in real time in order to proceed safely.  99  The task becomes more challenging the further into the future the prediction extends requiring rapid revisions to the estimate to cope with unpredicted behavior. One approach is to wholly recompute the position and trajectory of each object many times per second. Another is to cache the results of an earlier prediction for use in the next one to reduce computational complexity.  163   164  Handover  edit  The ADAS has to be able to safely accept control from and return control to the driver.  165  Trust  edit  Consumers will avoid ACs unless they trust them as safe.  166   167  Robotaxis operating in San Francisco received pushback over perceived safety risks.  168  Automatic elevators were invented in 1900 but did not become common until operator strikes and trust was built with advertising and features such as an emergency stop button.  169   170  However with repeated use of autonomous driving functions drivers behavior and trust in autonomous vehicles gradually improved and both entered a more stable state. At the same time this also improved the performance and reliability of the vehicle in complex conditions thereby increasing public trust.  171  Economics  edit  Autonomous also present various political and economic implications. The transportation sector holds significant sway in many the political and economic landscapes. For instance many US states generates much annual revenue from transportation fees and taxes.  172  The advent of selfdriving cars could profoundly affect the economy by potentially altering state tax revenue streams. Furthermore the transition to autonomous vehicles might disrupt employment patterns and labor markets particularly in industries heavily reliant on driving professions.  172  Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that in 2019 the sector employed over two million individuals as tractortrailer truck drivers.  173  Additionally taxi and delivery drivers represented approximately 370400 positions and bus drivers constituted a workforce of over 680000.  174   175   176  Collectively this amounts to a conceivable displacement of nearly 2.9 million jobs surpassing the job losses experienced in the 2008 Great Recession.  177  Equity and Inclusion  edit  The prominence of certain demographic groups within the tech industry inevitably shapes the trajectory of autonomous vehicle AV development potentially perpetuating existing inequalities. There are others in society without a political agenda who believe that the advancement of technology has nothing to do with promoting inequalities in certain groups and see this as a ridiculous presumption.  178  Ethical issues  edit  See also Machine ethics Pedestrian Detection  edit  Research from Georgia Tech revealed that autonomous vehicle detection systems were generally five percent less effective at recognizing darkerskinned individuals. This accuracy gap persisted despite adjustments for environmental variables like lighting and visual obstructions.  179  Rationale for liability  edit  Standards for liability have yet to be adopted to address crashes and other incidents. Liability could rest with the vehicle occupant its owner the vehicle manufacturer or even the ADAS technology supplier possibly depending on the circumstances of the crash.  180  Additionally the infusion of ArtificiaI Intelligence technology in autonomous vehicles adds layers of complexity to ownership and ethical dynamics. Given that AI systems are inherently selflearning a question arises of whether accountability should rest with the vehicle owner the manufacturer or the AI developer  181  Trolley problem  edit  The trolley problem is a thought experiment in ethics . Adapted for ACs it considers an AC carrying one passenger confronts a pedestrian who steps in its way. The ADAS notionally has to choose between killing the pedestrian or swerving into a wall killing the passenger.  182  Possible frameworks include deontology formal rules and utilitarianism harm reduction.  99   183   184  One public opinion survey reported that harm reduction was preferred except that passengers wanted the vehicle to prefer them while pedestrians took the opposite view. Utilitarian regulations were unpopular.  185  Additionally cultural viewpoints exert substantial influence on shaping responses to these ethical quandaries. Another study found that cultural biases impact preferences in prioritizing the rescue of certain individuals over others in car accident scenarios.  181  Privacy  edit  Some ACs require an internet connection to function opening the possibility that a hacker might gain access to private information such as destinations routes camera recordings media preferences andor behavioral patterns although this is true of an internetconnected device.  186   187   188  Road infrastructure  edit  ACs make use of road infrastructure e.g. traffic signs turn lanes and may require modifications to that infrastructure to fully achieve their safety and other goals.  189  In March 2023 the Japanese government unveiled a plan to set up a dedicated highway lane for ACs.  190  In April 2023 JR East announced their challenge to raise their selfdriving level of Kesennuma Line bus rapid transit BRT in rural area from the current Level 2 to Level 4 at 60 kmh.  191  Testing  edit  Approaches  edit  ACs can be tested via digital simulations  192   193  in a controlled test environment  194  andor on public roads. Road testing typically requires some form of permit  195  or a commitment to adhere to acceptable operating principles.  196  For example New York requires a test driver to be in the vehicle prepared to override the ADAS as necessary.  197  2010s and disengagements  edit  A prototype of Waymo s selfdriving car navigating public streets in Mountain View California in 2017 In California selfdriving car manufacturers are required to submit annual reports describing how often their vehicles autonomously disengaged from autonomous mode.  198  This is one measure of system robustness ideally the system should never disengage.  199  In 2017 Waymo reported 63 disengagements over 352545 mi 567366 km of testing an average distance of 5596 mi 9006 km between disengagements the highest best among companies reporting such figures. Waymo also logged more autonomous miles than other companies. Their 2017 rate of 0.18 disengagements per 1000 mi 1600 km was an improvement over the 0.2 disengagements per 1000 mi 1600 km in 2016 and 0.8 in 2015. In March 2017 Uber reported an average of 0.67 mi 1.08 km per disengagement.

SAE Level 3 and 4 functions were tested on ordinary roads.  205   206   207  In November 2022 an International Standard ISO 34502 on  Scenario based safety evaluation framework was published.  208   209  Collision avoidance  edit  In April 2022 collision avoidance testing was demonstrated by Nissan .  210   211  Waymo published a document about collision avoidance testing in December 2022.  212  Simulation and validation  edit  In September 2022 Biprogy released Driving Intelligence Validation Platform DIVP as part of Japanese national project SIPadus which is interoperable with Open Simulation Interface OSI of ASAM .  213   214   215  Toyota  edit  In November 2022 Toyota demonstrated one of its GR Yaris test cars which had been trained using professional rally drivers.  216  Toyota used its collaboration with Microsoft in FIA World Rally Championship since the 2017 season.  217  Pedestrian reactions  edit  In 2023 David R. Large senior research fellow with the Human Factors Research Group at the University of Nottingham  disguised himself as a car seat in a study to test peoples reactions to driverless cars. He said We wanted to explore how pedestrians would interact with a driverless car and developed this unique methodology to explore their reactions. The study found that in the absence of someone in the driving seat pedestrians trust certain visual prompts more than others when deciding whether to cross the road.  218  Incidents  edit  Tesla  edit  See also List of Tesla Autopilot crashes As of 2023 Teslas ADAS Autopilot Full Self Driving beta was classified as Level 2 ADAS.  219  On 20 January 2016 the first of five known fatal crashes of a Tesla with Autopilot occurred in Chinas Hubei province.  220  Initially Tesla stated that the vehicle was so badly damaged from the impact that their recorder was not able to determine whether the car had been on Autopilot at the time. However the car failed to take evasive action. Another fatal Autopilot crash occurred in May in Florida in a Tesla Model S  221   222  that crashed into a tractortrailer . In a civil suit between the father of the driver killed and Tesla Tesla documented that the car had been on Autopilot.  223  According to Tesla neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractortrailer against a brightly lit sky so the brake was not applied. Tesla claimed that this was Teslas first known Autopilot death in over 130 million miles 210 million kilometers with Autopilot engaged. Tesla claimed that on average one fatality occurs every 94 million miles 151 million kilometers across all vehicle types in the US.  224   225   226  However this number also includes motorcyclepedestrian fatalities.  227   228  The ultimate National Transportation Safety Board NTSB report concluded Tesla was not at fault the investigation revealed that for Tesla cars the crash rate dropped by 40 percent after Autopilot was installed.  229  Google Waymo  edit  See also Waymo  Crashes Googles inhouse automated car In June 2015 Google confirmed that 12 vehicles had suffered collisions as of that date. Eight involved rearend collisions at a stop sign or traffic light in two of which the vehicle was sideswiped by another driver one in which another driver rolled a stop sign and one where a driver was controlling the car manually.  230  In July 2015 three employees suffered minor injuries when their vehicle was rearended by a car whose driver failed to brake. This was the first collision that resulted in injuries.  231  According to Google Waymos accident reports as of early 2016 their test cars had been involved in 14 collisions of which other drivers were at fault 13 times although in 2016 the cars software caused a crash.  232  On 14 February 2016 a Google vehicle attempted to avoid sandbags blocking its path. During the maneuver it struck a bus. Google stated In this case we clearly bear some responsibility because if our car hadnt moved there wouldnt have been a collision.  233   234  Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience. No injuries were reported.  232  Ubers Advanced Technologies Group ATG  edit  In March 2018 Elaine Herzberg died after she was hit by an AC tested by Ubers Advanced Technologies Group ATG in Arizona. A safety driver was in the car. Herzberg was crossing the road about 400 feet from an intersection.  235  Some experts said a human driver could have avoided the crash.  236  Arizona governor Doug Ducey suspended the companys ability to test its ACs citing an unquestionable failure of Uber to protect public safety.  237  Uber also stopped testing in California until receiving a new permit in 2020.  238   239  NTSBs final report determined that the immediate cause of the accident was that safety driver Rafaela Vasquez failed to monitor the road because she was distracted by her phone but that Ubers inadequate safety culture contributed. The report noted that the victim had a very high level of methamphetamine in her body.  240  The board called on federal regulators to carry out a review before allowing automated test vehicles to operate on public roads.  241   242  In September 2020 Vasquez pled guilty to endangerment and was sentenced to three years probation.  243   39  NIO Navigate on Pilot  edit  On 12 August 2021 a 31yearold Chinese man was killed after his NIO ES8 collided with a construction vehicle.  citation needed  NIOs selfdriving feature was in beta and could not deal with static obstacles.  244  The vehicles manual clearly stated that the driver must take over near construction sites. Lawyers of the deceaseds family questioned NIOs private access to the vehicle which they argued did not guarantee the integrity of the data.  245  Pony.ai  edit  In November 2021 the California Department of Motor Vehicles DMV notified Pony.ai that it was suspending its testing permit following a reported collision in Fremont on 28 October.  246  In May 2022 DMV revoked Pony.ais permit for failing to monitor the driving records of its safety drivers.  247  Cruise  edit  See also Cruise autonomous vehicle  Incidents In April 2022 Cruise s testing vehicle was reported to have blocked a fire engine on emergency call and sparked questions about its ability to handle unexpected circumstances.  248   249  Ford  edit  In February 2024 a driver using the Ford BlueCruise handsfree driving feature struck and killed the driver of a stationary car with no lights on in the middle lane of a freeway in Texas.  250  In March 2024 a drunk driver who was speeding holding her cell phone and using BlueCruise on a Pennsylvania freeway struck and killed two people who had been driving two cars.  251  The first car had become disabled and was on the left shoulder with part of the car in the left driving lane.  251  The second driver had parked his car behind the first car presumably to help the first driver.  251  The NTSB is investigating both incidents.  252  Total incidents  edit  The NHTSA began mandating incident reports from autonomous vehicle companies in June 2021. Some reports cite incidents from as early as August 2019 with current data available through June 17 2024.  253  There have been a total of 3979 autonomous vehicle incidents both ADS and ADAS reported during this timeframe. 2146 of those incidents 53.9 involved Tesla vehicles.  254  Public opinion surveys  edit  2010s  edit  In a 2011 online survey of 2006 US and UK consumers 49 said they would be comfortable using a driverless car.  255  A 2012 survey of 17400 vehicle owners found 37 who initially said they would be interested in purchasing a fully autonomous car. However that figure dropped to 20 if told the technology would cost US3000 more.  256  In a 2012 survey of about 1000 German drivers 22 had a positive attitude 10 were undecided 44 were skeptical and 24 were hostile.  257  A 2013 survey of 1500 consumers across 10 countries found 57 stated they would be likely to ride in a car controlled entirely by technology that does not require a human driver with Brazil India and China the most willing to trust automated technology.  258  In a 2014 US telephone survey over threequarters of licensed drivers said they would consider buying a selfdriving car rising to 86 if car insurance were cheaper. 31.7 said they would not continue to drive once an automated car was available.  259  In 2015 a survey of 5000 people from 109 countries reported that average respondents found manual driving the most enjoyable. 22 did not want to pay more money for autonomy. Respondents were found to be most concerned about hackingmisuse and were also concerned about legal issues and safety. Finally respondents from more developed countries were less comfortable with their vehicle sharing data.  260  The survey reported consumer interest in purchasing an AC stating that 37 of surveyed current owners were either definitely or probably interested.  260  In 2016 a survey of 1603 people in Germany that controlled for age gender and education reported that men felt less anxiety and more enthusiasm whereas women showed the opposite. The difference was pronounced between young men and women and decreased with age.  261  In a 2016 US  survey of 1584 people 66 percent of respondents said they think autonomous cars are probably smarter than the average human driver. People were worried about safety and hacking risk. Nevertheless only 13 of the interviewees saw no advantages in this new kind of cars.  262  In a 2017 survey of 4135 US adults found that many Americans anticipated significant impacts from various automation technologies including the widespread adoption of automated vehicles.  263  In 2019 results from two opinion surveys of 54 and 187 US adults respectively were published. The questionnaire was termed the autonomous vehicle acceptance model AVAM including additional description to help respondents better understand the implications of various automation levels. Users were less accepting of high autonomy levels and displayed significantly lower intention to use autonomous vehicles. Additionally partial autonomy regardless of level was perceived as requiring uniformly higher driver engagement usage of hands feet and eyes than full autonomy.  264  In the 2020s  edit  In 2022 a survey reported that only a quarter 27 of the worlds population would feel safe in selfdriving cars.  265  In 2024 a study by Saravanos et al.  266  at New York University reported that 87 of their respondents from a sample of 358 believed that conditionally automated cars at Level 3 would be easy to use. Opinion surveys may have little salience given that few respondents had any personal experience with ACs. Regulation  edit  Main article Regulation of selfdriving cars See also Regulation of algorithms The regulation of autonomous cars concerns liability approvals and international conventions. In the 2010s researchers openly worried that delayed regulations could delay deployment.  267  In 2020 UNECE WP.29 GRVA was issued to address regulation of Level 3 automated driving. Commercialization  edit  See also History of selfdriving cars  The 2020s Vehicles operating below Level 5 still offer many advantages.  268  As of 2023 update most commercially available ADAS vehicles are SAE Level 2. A couple of companies reached higher levels but only in restricted geofenced locations.  269  Level 2  Partial Automation  edit  See also Lane centering  Sample of level 2 automated cars  and List of selfdriving system suppliers  Date of first public road driverless operation SAE Level 2 features are available as part of the ADAS systems in many vehicles. In the US 50 of new cars provide driver assistance for both steering and speed.  270  Ford started offering BlueCruise service on certain vehicles in 2022 the system is named ActiveGlide in Lincoln vehicles. The system provided features such as lane centering street sign recognition and handsfree highway driving on more than 130000 miles of divided highways. The 2022 1.2 version added features including handsfree lane changing inlane repositioning and predictive speed assist.  271   272  In April 2023 BlueCruise was approved in the UK for use on certain motorways starting with 2023 models of Fords electric Mustang MachE SUV.  273  Teslas Autopilot and its Full SelfDriving FSD ADAS suites are available on all Tesla cars since 2016. FSD offers highway and street driving without geofencing navigationturn management steering and dynamic cruise control collision avoidance lanekeepingswitching emergency braking obstacle avoidance but still requires the driver to remain ready to control the vehicle at any moment. Its driver management system combines eye tracking with monitoring pressure on the steering wheel to ensure that drives are both eyes on and hands on.  274   275  Teslas FSD rewrite V12 released in March 2024 uses a single deep learning transformer model for all aspects of perception monitoring and control.  276   277  It relies on its eight cameras for its visiononly perception system without use of LiDAR radar or ultrasound.  277  As of April 2024 FSD has been deployed on two million Tesla cars.  278  As of January 2024 Tesla has not initiated requests for Level 3 status for its systems and has not disclosed its reason for not doing so.  275  Development  edit  General Motors is developing the Ultra Cruise ADAS system that will be a dramatic improvement over their current Super Cruise system. Ultra Cruise will cover 95 percent of driving scenarios on 2 million miles of roads in the US according to the company. The system hardware in and around the car includes multiple cameras short and longrange radar and a LiDAR sensor and will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon Ride Platform. The luxury Cadillac Celestiq electric vehicle will be one of the first vehicles to feature Ultra Cruise.  279  Europe is developing a new Driver Control Assistance Systems DCAS level 2 regulation to no longer limit the use of lane changing systems to roads with 2 lanes and a physical separation from traffic in the opposite direction .  280   281  Level 3  Conditional Automation  edit  As of April 2024 update  two car manufacturers have sold or leased Level 3 cars Honda in Japan and Mercedes in Germany Nevada and California.  53  Mercedes Drive Pilot has been available on the EQS and Sclass sedan in Germany since 2022 and in California and Nevada since 2023.  68  A subscription costs between 5000 and 7000 for three years in Germany and 2500 for one year in the United States.  282  Drive Pilot can only be used when the vehicle is traveling under 40 miles per hour 64 kmh there is a vehicle in front readable line markings during the day clear weather and on freeways mapped by Mercedes down to the centimeter 100000 miles in California.  282   68  As of April 2024 one Mercedes vehicle with this capability has been sold in California.  282  Development  edit  Honda continued to enhance its Level 3 technology.  283   284  As of 2023 80 vehicles with Level 3 support had been sold.  285  MercedesBenz received authorization in early 2023 to pilot its Level 3 software in Las Vegas.  15  California also authorized Drive Pilot in 2023.  286  BMW commercialized its AC in 2021.  287  In 2023 BMW stated that its Level3 technology was nearing release. It would be the second manufacturer to deliver Level3 technology but the only one with a Level 3 technology which works in the dark .  288  In 2023 in China IM Motors  Mercedes  and BMW obtained authorization to test vehicles with Level 3 systems on motorways.  289   290  In September 2021 Stellantis presented its findings from its Level 3 pilot testing on Italian highways. Stellantiss Highway Chauffeur claimed Level 3 capabilities as tested on the Maserati Ghibli and Fiat 500X prototypes.  291  Polestar  a Volvo Cars  brand announced in January 2022 its plan to offer Level 3 autonomous driving system in the Polestar 3 SUV a Volvo XC90 successor with technologies from Luminar Technologies  Nvidia  and Zenseact.  292  In January 2022 Bosch and the Volkswagen Group subsidiary CARIAD released a collaboration for autonomous driving up to Level 3. This joint development targets Level 4 capabilities.  293  Hyundai Motor Company is enhancing cybersecurity of connected cars to offer a Level 3 selfdriving Genesis G90 .  294  Kia and Hyundai Korean car makers delayed their Level 3 plans and will not deliver Level 3 vehicles in 2023.  295  Level 4  High Automation  edit  Waymo offers robotaxi services in parts of Arizona Phoenix and California San Francisco and Los Angeles as fully autonomous vehicles without safety drivers.  296  In April 2023 in Japan a Level 4 protocol became part of the amended Road Traffic Act.  297  ZEN drive Pilot Level 4 made by AIST operates there.  298  Development  edit  In July 2020 Toyota started public demonstration rides on Lexus LS fifth generation based TRIP4 with Level 4 capability.  299  In August 2021 Toyota operated a potentially Level 4 service using ePalette around the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Village.  300  In September 2020 MercedesBenz introduced worlds first commercial Level 4 Automated Valet Parking AVP system named Intelligent Park Pilot for its new SClass .  301   302  In November 2022 Germanys Federal Motor Transport Authority KBA approved the system for use at Stuttgart Airport .  303  In September 2021 Cruise General Motors and Honda started a joint testing programme using Cruise AV.  304  In 2023 the Origin was put on indefinite hold following Cruises loss of its operating permit.  305  In January 2023 Holon announced an autonomous shuttle during the 2023 Consumer Electronics Show CES. The company claimed the vehicle is the worlds first Level 4 shuttle built to automotive standard.  306  See also  edit  Autopilot Driving References  edit   a b Taeihagh Araz Lim Hazel Si Min 2 January 2019.
