Set of stealthy and continuous computer hacking processes An advanced persistent threat  APT  is a stealthy threat actor  typically a state or statesponsored group which gains unauthorized access to a computer network and remains undetected for an extended period.  1   2  In recent times the term may also refer to nonstatesponsored groups conducting largescale targeted intrusions for specific goals.  3  Such threat actors motivations are typically political or economic.  4  Every major business sector has recorded instances of cyberattacks by advanced actors with specific goals whether to steal spy or disrupt. These targeted sectors include government defense  financial services  legal services  industrial  telecoms  consumer goods and many more.  5   6   7  Some groups utilize traditional espionage vectors including social engineering  human intelligence and infiltration to gain access to a physical location to enable network attacks. The purpose of these attacks is to install custom malware .  8  APT attacks on mobile devices have also become a legitimate concern since attackers are able to penetrate into cloud and mobile infrastructure to eavesdrop steal and tamper with data.  9  The median dwelltime the time an APT attack goes undetected differs widely between regions. FireEye reported the mean dwelltime for 2018 in the Americas as 71 days EMEA as 177 days and APAC as 204 days.  5  Such a long dwelltime allows attackers a significant amount of time to go through the attack cycle propagate and achieve their objectives. Definition  edit  Definitions of precisely what an APT is can vary but can be summarized by their named requirements below Advanced  Operators behind the threat have a full spectrum of intelligencegathering techniques at their disposal. These may include commercial and open source computer intrusion technologies and techniques but may also extend to include the intelligence apparatus of a state. While individual components of the attack may not be considered particularly advanced e.g. malware components generated from commonly available doityourself malware construction kits or the use of easily procured exploit materials their operators can typically access and develop more advanced tools as required. They often combine multiple targeting methods tools and techniques in order to reach and compromise their target and maintain access to it. Operators may also demonstrate a deliberate focus on operational security that differentiates them from less advanced threats.  3   10   11  Persistent  Operators have specific objectives rather than opportunistically seeking information for financial or other gain. This distinction implies that the attackers are guided by external entities. The targeting is conducted through continuous monitoring and interaction in order to achieve the defined objectives. It does not mean a barrage of constant attacks and malware updates. In fact a lowandslow approach is usually more successful. If the operator loses access to their target they usually will reattempt access and most often successfully. One of the operators goals is to maintain longterm access to the target in contrast to threats who only need access to execute a specific task.  10   12  Threat  APTs are a threat because they have both capability and intent. APT attacks are executed by coordinated human actions rather than by mindless and automated pieces of code. The operators have a specific objective and are skilled motivated organized and well funded. Actors are not limited to state sponsored groups.  3   10  History and targets  edit  Warnings against targeted sociallyengineered emails dropping trojans to exfiltrate sensitive information were published by UK and US CERT organisations in 2005. This method was used throughout the early 1990s and does not in itself constitute an APT. The term advanced persistent threat has been cited as originating from the United States Air Force in 2006  13  with Colonel Greg Rattray cited as the individual who coined the term.  14  The Stuxnet computer worm  which targeted the computer hardware of Irans nuclear program  is one example of an APT attack. In this case the Iranian government might consider the Stuxnet creators to be an advanced persistent threat.  citation needed   15  Within the computer security community and increasingly within the media the term is almost always used in reference to a longterm pattern of sophisticated computer network exploitation aimed at governments companies and political activists and by extension also to ascribe the A P and T attributes to the groups behind these attacks.  16  Advanced persistent threat APT as a term may be shifting focus to computerbased hacking due to the rising number of occurrences. PC World reported an 81 percent increase from 2010 to 2011 of particularly advanced targeted computer attacks.  17  Actors in many countries have used cyberspace as a means to gather intelligence on individuals and groups of individuals of interest.  18   19   20  The United States Cyber Command is tasked with coordinating the US militarys offensive and defensive cyber operations.  21  Numerous sources have alleged that some APT groups are affiliated with or are agents of governments of sovereign states .  22   23   24  Businesses holding a large quantity of personally identifiable information are at high risk of being targeted by advanced persistent threats including  25  Agriculture  26  Energy Financial institutions Health care Higher education  27  Manufacturing Technology Telecommunications Transportation A Bell Canada study provided deep research into the anatomy of APTs and uncovered widespread presence in Canadian government and critical infrastructure. Attribution was established to Chinese and Russian actors.  28  Life cycle  edit  A diagram depicting the life cycle staged approach of an advanced persistent threat APT which repeats itself once complete. Actors behind advanced persistent threats create a growing and changing risk to organizations financial assets intellectual property and reputation  29  by following a continuous process or kill chain  Target specific organizations for a singular objective Attempt to gain a foothold in the environment common tactics include spear phishing emails Use the compromised systems as access into the target network Deploy additional tools that help fulfill the attack objective Cover tracks to maintain access for future initiatives In 2013 Mandiant presented results of their research on alleged Chinese attacks using APT method between 2004 and 2013  30  that followed similar lifecycle Initial compromise  performed by use of social engineering and spear phishing  over email using zeroday viruses . Another popular infection method was planting malware on a website that the victims employees will be likely to visit.  31  Establish foothold  plant remote administration software in victims network create net backdoors and tunnels allowing stealth access to its infrastructure. Escalate privileges  use exploits and password cracking to acquire administrator privileges over victims computer and possibly expand it to Windows domain administrator accounts. Internal reconnaissance  collect information on surrounding infrastructure trust relationships Windows domain structure. Move laterally  expand control to other workstations servers and infrastructure elements and perform data harvesting on them. Maintain presence  ensure continued control over access channels and credentials acquired in previous steps. Complete mission  exfiltrate stolen data from victims network. In incidents analysed by Mandiant the average period over which the attackers controlled the victims network was one year with longest  almost five years.  30  The infiltrations were allegedly performed by Shanghaibased Unit 61398 of Peoples Liberation Army . Chinese officials have denied any involvement in these attacks.  32  Previous reports from Secdev had previously discovered and implicated Chinese actors.  33  Mitigation strategies  edit  There are tens of millions of malware variations  34  which makes it extremely challenging to protect organizations from APT. While APT activities are stealthy and hard to detect the command and control network traffic associated with APT can be detected at the network layer level with sophisticated methods. Deep log analyses and log correlation from various sources is of limited usefulness in detecting APT activities. It is challenging to separate noises from legitimate traffic. Traditional security technology and methods have been ineffective in detecting or mitigating APTs.  35  Active cyber defense has yielded greater efficacy in detecting and prosecuting APTs find fix finish when applying cyber threat intelligence to hunt and adversary pursuit activities.  36   37  HumanIntroduced Cyber Vulnerabilities HICV are a weak cyber link that are neither well understood nor mitigated constituting a significant attack vector.  38  APT groups  edit  China  edit  See also Cyberwarfare by China  Chinese information operations and information warfare  and Chinese intelligence activity abroad PLA Unit 61398 also known as APT1 PLA Unit 61486 also known as APT2 Buckeye also known as APT3  39  Red Apollo also known as APT10 Numbered Panda also known as APT12 DeputyDog also known as APT17  40  Dynamite Panda or Scandium also known as APT18 a unit of the Peoples Liberation Army Navy   41  Codoso Team also known as APT19 Wocao also known as APT20  42   43  APT22 aka Suckfly  44  APT26 aka Turbine Panda  45  APT 27  46  PLA Unit 78020 also known as APT30 and Naikon  Zirconium  47  also known as APT31 and Violet Typhoon  48   49   50  APT40 Double Dragon  51  also known as APT41 Winnti Group Barium or Axiom  52   53  Spamouflage also known as Dragonbridge or Storm 1376  54   55  Hafnium  56   57  LightBasin  58   59  Also known as UNC1945 Tropic Trooper  60  Volt Typhoon  61  Flax Typhoon  62  Charcoal Typhoon also known as CHROMIUM  63   64  Salmon Typhoon also known as SODIUM  63   64  Salt Typhoon also known as GhostEmperor or FamousSparrow  65   66  Liminal Panda  67  Iran  edit  Charming Kitten also known as APT35 Elfin Team also known as APT33 Helix Kitten also known as APT34 Pioneer Kitten  68  Remix Kitten also known as APT39 ITG07 or Chafer  69   70  North Korea  edit  Kimsuky Lazarus Group also known as APT38 Ricochet Chollima also known as APT37 Russia  edit  Berserk Bear Cozy Bear also known as APT29 Fancy Bear also known as APT28 FIN7 Gamaredon  71  also known as Primitive Bear   a  Sandworm also known as APT44 Venomous Bear  74  Turkey  edit  StrongPity also known as APTC41 or PROMETHIUM   75  United States  edit  Equation Group  76  Uzbekistan  edit  SandCat associated with the State Security Service according to Kaspersky  77  Vietnam  edit  OceanLotus also known as APT32   78   79  Naming  edit  Multiple organizations may assign different names to the same actor. As separate researchers could each have their own varying assessments of an APT group companies such as CrowdStrike  Kaspersky  Mandiant  and Microsoft  among others have their own internal naming schemes.  80  Names between different organizations may refer to overlapping but ultimately different groups based on various data gathered. CrowdStrike assigns animals by nationstate or other category such as Kitten for Iran and Spider for groups focused on cybercrime.  81  Other companies have named groups based on this system  Rampant Kitten for instance was named by Check Point rather than CrowdStrike.  82  Dragos bases its names for APT groups on minerals.  80  Mandiant assigns numbered acronyms in three categories APT FIN and UNC resulting in APT names like FIN7 . Other companies using a similar system include Proofpoint TA and IBM ITG and Hive.  80  Microsoft used to assign names from the periodic table  often stylized in allcaps e.g. POTASSIUM  in April 2023 Microsoft changed its naming schema to use weatherbased names e.g. Volt Typhoon.  83  See also  edit  Bureau 121 Chinese intelligence activity abroad Cyber spying Darkhotel Fileless malware Ghostnet Kill chain NetSpectre Operation Aurora Operation Shady RAT Proactive cyber defence Spearphishing Spyware Stuxnet Tailored Access Operations Unit 180 Unit 8200 Notes  edit   active since 2013 unlike most APTs Gamaredon broadly targets all users all over the globe in addition to also focusing on certain victims especially Ukrainian organizations  72   and appears to provide services for other APTs.  73  For example the InvisiMole threat group has attacked select systems that Gamaredon had earlier compromised and fingerprinted.  72  References  edit   What Is an Advanced Persistent Threat APT . www.kaspersky.com .
