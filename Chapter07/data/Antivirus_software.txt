Computer software to defend against malicious computer viruses Antivirus redirects here. For the medication see Antiviral drug . ClamTk  an opensource antivirus based on the ClamAV antivirus engine  was originally developed by Tomasz Kojm in 2001. Antivirus software abbreviated to AV software  also known as antimalware  is a computer program used to prevent detect and remove malware . Antivirus software was originally developed to detect and remove computer viruses  hence the name. However with the proliferation of other malware  antivirus software started to protect against other computer threats. Some products also include protection from malicious URLs  spam  and phishing .  1  History  edit  Further information History of computer viruses See also Timeline of computer viruses and worms 19711980 period preantivirus days  edit  The first known computer virus appeared in 1971 and was dubbed the  Creeper virus .  2  This computer virus infected Digital Equipment Corporation s  DEC  PDP10 mainframe computers running the TENEX operating system.  3   4  The Creeper virus was eventually deleted by a program created by Ray Tomlinson and known as  The Reaper .  5  Some people consider The Reaper the first antivirus software ever written  it may be the case but it is important to note that the Reaper was actually a virus itself specifically designed to remove the Creeper virus.  5   6  The Creeper virus was followed by several other viruses. The first known that appeared in the wild was  Elk Cloner  in 1981 which infected Apple II computers.  7   8   9  In 1983 the term computer virus was coined by Fred Cohen in one of the first ever published academic papers on computer viruses .  10  Cohen used the term computer virus to describe programs that affect other computer programs by modifying them in such a way as to include a possibly evolved copy of itself.  11  note that a more recent definition of computer virus has been given by the Hungarian security researcher Péter Szőr  a code that recursively replicates a possibly evolved copy of itself .  12   13  The first IBM PC compatible in the wild computer virus and one of the first real widespread infections was  Brain  in 1986. From then the number of viruses has grown exponentially.  14   15  Most of the computer viruses written in the early and mid1980s were limited to selfreproduction and had no specific damage routine built into the code. That changed when more and more programmers became acquainted with computer virus programming and created viruses that manipulated or even destroyed data on infected computers.  16  Before internet connectivity was widespread computer viruses were typically spread by infected floppy disks . Antivirus software came into use but was updated relatively infrequently. During this time virus checkers essentially had to check executable files and the boot sectors of floppy disks and hard disks. However as internet usage became common viruses began to spread online.  17  19801990 period early days  edit  There are competing claims for the innovator of the first antivirus product. Possibly the first publicly documented removal of an in the wild computer virus the Vienna virus was performed by Bernd Fix in 1987.  18   19  In 1987 Andreas Lüning and Kai Figge who founded G Data Software in 1985 released their first antivirus product for the Atari ST platform.  20  In 1987 the Ultimate Virus Killer UVK was also released.  21  This was the de facto industry standard virus killer for the Atari ST and Atari Falcon  the last version of which version 9.0 was released in April 2004.  citation needed  In 1987 in the United States John McAfee founded the McAfee company and at the end of that year he released the first version of VirusScan .  22  Also in 1987 in Czechoslovakia  Peter Paško Rudolf Hrubý  and Miroslav Trnka created the first version of NOD antivirus.  23   24  In 1987 Fred Cohen wrote that there is no algorithm that can perfectly detect all possible computer viruses .  25  Finally at the end of 1987 the first two heuristic antivirus utilities were released Flushot Plus by Ross Greenberg  26   27   28  and Anti4us by Erwin Lanting.  29  In his OReilly book Malicious Mobile Code Virus Protection for Windows  Roger Grimes described Flushot Plus as the first holistic program to fight malicious mobile code MMC.  30  However the kind of heuristic used by early AV engines was totally different from those used today. The first product with a heuristic engine resembling modern ones was FPROT in 1991.  31  Early heuristic engines were based on dividing the binary into different sections data section code section in a legitimate binary it usually starts always from the same location. Indeed the initial viruses reorganized the layout of the sections or overrode the initial portion of a section in order to jump to the very end of the file where malicious code was locatedonly going back to resume execution of the original code. This was a very specific pattern not used at the time by any legitimate software which represented an elegant heuristic to catch suspicious code. Other kinds of more advanced heuristics were later added such as suspicious section names incorrect header size regular expressions and partial pattern inmemory matching. In 1988 the growth of antivirus companies continued. In Germany Tjark Auerbach founded Avira  HBEDV at the time and released the first version of AntiVir named Luke Filewalker at the time. In Bulgaria  Vesselin Bontchev released his first freeware antivirus program he later joined FRISK Software . Also Frans Veldman released the first version of ThunderByte Antivirus  also known as TBAV he sold his company to Norman Safeground in 1998. In Czechoslovakia  Pavel Baudiš and Eduard Kučera founded Avast Software at the time ALWIL Software  and released their first version of avast antivirus. In June 1988 in South Korea  Ahn CheolSoo released its first antivirus software called V1 he founded AhnLab later in 1995. Finally in autumn 1988 in the United Kingdom Alan Solomon founded SS International and created his Dr. Solomons AntiVirus Toolkit although he launched it commercially only in 1991  in 1998 Solomons company was acquired by McAfee  then known as Network Associates Inc.. Also in 1988 a mailing list named VIRUSL  32  was started on the BITNET  EARN network where new viruses and the possibilities of detecting and eliminating viruses were discussed. Some members of this mailing list were Alan Solomon Eugene Kaspersky  Kaspersky Lab  Friðrik Skúlason  FRISK Software  John McAfee  McAfee  Luis Corrons  Panda Security  Mikko Hyppönen  FSecure  Péter Szőr  Tjark Auerbach  Avira  and Vesselin Bontchev  FRISK Software .  32  In 1989 in Iceland  Friðrik Skúlason created the first version of FPROT AntiVirus he founded FRISK Software only in 1993. Meanwhile in the United States Symantec founded by Gary Hendrix in 1982 launched its first Symantec antivirus for Macintosh SAM.  33   34  SAM 2.0 released March 1990 incorporated technology allowing users to easily update SAM to intercept and eliminate new viruses including many that didnt exist at the time of the programs release.  35  In the end of the 1980s in United Kingdom Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer founded the security firm Sophos and began producing their first antivirus and encryption products. In the same period in Hungary VirusBuster was founded and subsequently incorporated by Sophos .  36  19902000 period emergence of the antivirus industry  edit  In 1990 in Spain Mikel Urizarbarrena founded Panda Security  Panda Software at the time.  37  In Hungary the security researcher Péter Szőr released the first version of Pasteur antivirus. In 1990 the Computer Antivirus Research Organization  CARO  was founded. In 1991 CARO released the Virus Naming Scheme  originally written by Friðrik Skúlason and Vesselin Bontchev.  38  Although this naming scheme is now outdated it remains the only existing standard that most computer security companies and researchers ever attempted to adopt. CARO members includes Alan Solomon Costin Raiu Dmitry Gryaznov Eugene Kaspersky  Friðrik Skúlason  Igor Muttik  Mikko Hyppönen  Morton Swimmer Nick FitzGerald Padgett Peterson  Peter Ferrie Righard Zwienenberg and Vesselin Bontchev.  39   40  In 1991 in the United States Symantec released the first version of Norton AntiVirus . In the same year in the Czech Republic  Jan Gritzbach and Tomáš Hofer founded AVG Technologies  Grisoft at the time although they released the first version of their AntiVirus Guard AVG only in 1992. On the other hand in Finland  FSecure founded in 1988 by Petri Allas and Risto Siilasmaa  with the name of Data Fellows released the first version of their antivirus product. FSecure claims to be the first antivirus firm to establish a presence on the World Wide Web.  41  In 1991 the European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research EICAR was founded to further antivirus research and improve development of antivirus software.  42   43  In 1992 in Russia Igor Danilov released the first version of SpiderWeb  which later became Dr.Web .  44  In 1994 AVTEST reported that there were 28613 unique malware samples based on MD5 in their database.  45  Over time other companies were founded. In 1996 in Romania  Bitdefender was founded and released the first version of AntiVirus eXpert AVX.  46  In 1997 in Russia Eugene Kaspersky and Natalya Kaspersky cofounded security firm Kaspersky Lab .  47  In 1996 there was also the first in the wild Linux virus known as  Staog  .  48  In 1999 AVTEST reported that there were 98428 unique malware samples based on MD5 in their database.  45  20002005 period  edit  In 2000 Rainer Link and Howard Fuhs started the first open source antivirus engine called OpenAntivirus Project .  49  In 2001 Tomasz Kojm released the first version of ClamAV  the first ever open source antivirus engine to be commercialised. In 2007 ClamAV was bought by Sourcefire   50  which in turn was acquired by Cisco Systems in 2013.  51  In 2002 in United Kingdom Morten Lund and Theis Søndergaard cofounded the antivirus firm BullGuard.  52  In 2005 AVTEST reported that there were 333425 unique malware samples based on MD5 in their database.  45  20052014 period  edit  In 2007 AVTEST reported a number of 5490960 new unique malware samples based on MD5 only for that year.  45  In 2012 and 2013 antivirus firms reported a new malware samples range from 300000 to over 500000 per day.  53   54  Over the years it has become necessary for antivirus software to use several different strategies e.g. specific email and network protection or low level modules and detection algorithms as well as to check an increasing variety of files rather than just executables for several reasons Powerful macros used in word processor applications such as Microsoft Word  presented a risk. Virus writers could use the macros to write viruses embedded within documents. This meant that computers could now also be at risk from infection by opening documents with hidden attached macros.  55  The possibility of embedding executable objects inside otherwise nonexecutable file formats can make opening those files a risk.  56  Later email programs in particular Microsofts Outlook Express and Outlook  were vulnerable to viruses embedded in the email body itself. A users computer could be infected by just opening or previewing a message.  57  In 2005 FSecure was the first security firm that developed an AntiRootkit technology called BlackLight . Because most users are usually connected to the Internet on a continual basis Jon Oberheide first proposed a Cloudbased antivirus design in 2008.  58  In February 2008 McAfee Labs added the industryfirst cloudbased antimalware functionality to VirusScan under the name Artemis. It was tested by AVComparatives in February 2008  59  and officially unveiled in August 2008 in McAfee VirusScan .  60  Cloud AV created problems for comparative testing of security software  part of the AV definitions was out of testers control on constantly updated AV company servers thus making results nonrepeatable. As a result AntiMalware Testing Standards Organisation AMTSO started working on method of testing cloud products which was adopted on May 7 2009.  61  In 2011 AVG introduced a similar cloud service called Protective Cloud Technology.  62  2014present rise of nextgen market consolidation  edit  Following the 2013 release of the APT 1 report from Mandiant  the industry has seen a shift towards signatureless approaches to the problem capable of detecting and mitigating zeroday attacks .  63  Numerous approaches to address these new forms of threats have appeared including behavioral detection artificial intelligence machine learning and cloudbased file detection. According to Gartner it is expected the rise of new entrants such Carbon Black  Cylance and Crowdstrike will force end point protection incumbents into a new phase of innovation and acquisition.  64  One method from Bromium involves microvirtualization to protect desktops from malicious code execution initiated by the end user. Another approach from SentinelOne and Carbon Black focuses on behavioral detection by building a full context around every process execution path in real time  65   66  while Cylance leverages an artificial intelligence model based on machine learning.  67  Increasingly these signatureless approaches have been defined by the media and analyst firms as nextgeneration antivirus  68  and are seeing rapid market adoption as certified antivirus replacement technologies by firms such as Coalfire and DirectDefense.  69  In response traditional antivirus vendors such as Trend Micro   70  Symantec and Sophos  71  have responded by incorporating nextgen offerings into their portfolios as analyst firms such as Forrester and Gartner have called traditional signaturebased antivirus ineffective and outdated.  72  As of Windows 8  Windows includes its own free antivirus protection under the Windows Defender brand. Despite bad detection scores in its early days AVTest now certifies Defender as one of its top products.  73   74  While it isnt publicly known how the inclusion of antivirus software in Windows affected antivirus sales Google search traffic for antivirus has declined significantly since 2010.  75  In 2014 Microsoft bought McAfee.  76  Since 2016 there has been a notable amount of consolidation in the industry. Avast purchased AVG in 2016 for 1.3 billion.  77  Avira was acquired by Norton owner Gen Digital then NortonLifeLock in 2020 for 360 million.  78  In 2021 the Avira division of Gen Digital acquired BullGuard.  79  The BullGuard brand was discontinued in 2022 and its customers were migrated to Norton. In 2022 Gen Digital acquired Avast effectively consolidating four major antivirus brands under one owner.  80  As of 2024 more than half of Americans use builtin antivirus protection for their devices like Microsoft Defender or XProtect from Apple . However about 121 million adults still use thirdparty antivirus software. Half of these adults use paid products and about 50 of thirdparty software users  the owners of personal computers and Windows operating systems.  81  Identification methods  edit  In 1987 Frederick B. Cohen demonstrated that the algorithm which would be able to detect all possible viruses cant possibly exist like the algorithm which determines whether or not the given program halts .  25  However using different layers of defense a good detection rate may be achieved. There are several methods which antivirus engines can use to identify malware Sandbox detection  a particular behaviouralbased detection technique that instead of detecting the behavioural fingerprint at run time it executes the programs in a virtual environment  logging what actions the program performs. Depending on the actions logged which can include memory usage and network accesses  82  the antivirus engine can determine if the program is malicious or not.  83  If not then the program is executed in the real environment. Although this technique has shown to be quite effective given its heaviness and slowness it is rarely used in enduser antivirus solutions.  84  Data mining techniques  one of the latest approaches applied in malware detection. Data mining and machine learning algorithms are used to try to classify the behaviour of a file as either malicious or benign given a series of file features that are extracted from the file itself.  85   86   87   88   89   90   91   92   93   94   95   96   97   98   excessive citations  Signaturebased detection  edit  Traditional antivirus software relies heavily upon signatures to identify malware.  99  Substantially when a malware sample arrives in the hands of an antivirus firm it is analysed by malware researchers or by dynamic analysis systems. Then once it is determined to be a malware a proper signature of the file is extracted and added to the signatures database of the antivirus software.  100  Although the signaturebased approach can effectively contain malware outbreaks malware authors have tried to stay a step ahead of such software by writing  oligomorphic   polymorphic  and more recently  metamorphic  viruses which encrypt parts of themselves or otherwise modify themselves as a method of disguise so as to not match virus signatures in the dictionary.  101  Heuristics  edit  Many viruses start as a single infection and through either mutation or refinements by other attackers can grow into dozens of slightly different strains called variants. Generic detection refers to the detection and removal of multiple threats using a single virus definition.  102  For example the Vundo trojan has several family members depending on the antivirus vendors classification. Symantec classifies members of the Vundo family into two distinct categories Trojan.Vundo and Trojan.Vundo.B .  103   104  While it may be advantageous to identify a specific virus it can be quicker to detect a virus family through a generic signature or through an inexact match to an existing signature. Virus researchers find common areas that all viruses in a family share uniquely and can thus create a single generic signature. These signatures often contain noncontiguous code using wildcard characters where differences lie. These wildcards allow the scanner to detect viruses even if they are padded with extra meaningless code.  105  A detection that uses this method is said to be heuristic detection. Rootkit detection  edit  Main article Rootkit Antivirus software can attempt to scan for rootkits. A rootkit is a type of malware designed to gain administrativelevel control over a computer system without being detected. Rootkits can change how the operating system functions and in some cases can tamper with the antivirus program and render it ineffective. Rootkits are also difficult to remove in some cases requiring a complete reinstallation of the operating system.  106  Realtime protection  edit  Realtime protection onaccess scanning background guard resident shield autoprotect and other synonyms refer to the automatic protection provided by most antivirus antispyware and other antimalware programs. This monitors computer systems for suspicious activity such as computer viruses spyware adware and other malicious objects. Realtime protection detects threats in opened files and scans apps in realtime as they are installed on the device.  107  When inserting a CD opening an email or browsing the web or when a file already on the computer is opened or executed.  108  Issues of concern  edit  Unexpected renewal costs  edit  Some commercial antivirus software enduser license agreements include a clause that the subscription will be automatically renewed and the purchasers credit card automatically billed at the renewal time without explicit approval. For example McAfee requires users to unsubscribe at least 60 days before the expiration of the present subscription  109  while Bitdefender sends notifications to unsubscribe 30 days before the renewal.  110  Norton AntiVirus also renews subscriptions automatically by default.  111  Rogue security applications  edit  Main article Rogue security software Some apparent antivirus programs are actually malware masquerading as legitimate software such as WinFixer  MS Antivirus  and Mac Defender .  112  Problems caused by false positives  edit  A false positive or false alarm is when antivirus software identifies a nonmalicious file as malware. When this happens it can cause serious problems. For example if an antivirus program is configured to immediately delete or quarantine infected files as is common on Microsoft Windows antivirus applications a false positive in an essential file can render the Windows operating system or some applications unusable.  113  Recovering from such damage to critical software infrastructure incurs technical support costs and businesses can be forced to close whilst remedial action is undertaken.  114   115  Examples of serious falsepositives May 2007 a faulty virus signature issued by Symantec mistakenly removed essential operating system files leaving thousands of PCs unable to boot .  116  May 2007 the executable file required by Pegasus Mail on Windows was falsely detected by Norton AntiVirus as being a Trojan and it was automatically removed preventing Pegasus Mail from running. Norton AntiVirus had falsely identified three releases of Pegasus Mail as malware and would delete the Pegasus Mail installer file when that happened.  117  In response to this Pegasus Mail stated On the basis that NortonSymantec has done this for every one of the last three releases of Pegasus Mail we can only condemn this product as too flawed to use and recommend in the strongest terms that our users cease using it in favour of alternative less buggy antivirus packages.  117  April 2010 McAfee VirusScan detected svchost.exe a normal Windows binary as a virus on machines running Windows XP with Service Pack 3 causing a reboot loop and loss of all network access.  118   119  December 2010 a faulty update on the AVG antivirus suite damaged 64bit versions of Windows 7  rendering it unable to boot due to an endless boot loop created.  120  October 2011 Microsoft Security Essentials MSE removed the Google Chrome web browser rival to Microsofts own Internet Explorer . MSE flagged Chrome as a Zbot banking trojan .  121  September 2012 Sophos  antivirus suite identified various updatemechanisms including its own as malware. If it was configured to automatically delete detected files Sophos Antivirus could render itself unable to update required manual intervention to fix the problem.  122   123  September 2017 the Google Play Protect antivirus started identifying Motorola s Moto G4 Bluetooth application as malware causing Bluetooth functionality to become disabled.  124  September 2022 Microsoft Defender flagged all Chromium based web browsers and Electron based apps like WhatsApp Discord Spotify as a severe threat.  125  System and interoperability related issues  edit  Running the realtime protection of multiple antivirus programs concurrently can degrade performance and create conflicts.  126  However using a concept called multiscanning  several companies including G Data Software  127  and Microsoft  128   have created applications which can run multiple engines concurrently. It is sometimes necessary to temporarily disable virus protection when installing major updates such as Windows Service Packs or updating graphics card drivers.  129  Active antivirus protection may partially or completely prevent the installation of a major update. Antivirus software can cause problems during the installation of an operating system upgrade e.g. when upgrading to a newer version of Windows in placewithout erasing the previous version of Windows. Microsoft recommends that antivirus software be disabled to avoid conflicts with the upgrade installation process.  130   131   132  Active antivirus software can also interfere with a firmware update process.  133  The functionality of a few computer programs can be hampered by active antivirus software. For example TrueCrypt  a disk encryption program states on its troubleshooting page that antivirus programs can conflict with TrueCrypt and cause it to malfunction or operate very slowly.  134  Antivirus software can impair the performance and stability of games running in the Steam platform.  135  Support issues also exist around antivirus application interoperability with common solutions like SSL VPN remote access and network access control products.  136  These technology solutions often have policy assessment applications that require an uptodate antivirus to be installed and running. If the antivirus application is not recognized by the policy assessment whether because the antivirus application has been updated or because it is not part of the policy assessment library the user will be unable to connect. Effectiveness  edit  Studies in December 2007 showed that the effectiveness of antivirus software had decreased in the previous year particularly against unknown or zero day attacks . The computer magazine ct found that detection rates for these threats had dropped from 40 to 50 in 2006 to 2030 in 2007. At that time the only exception was the NOD32 antivirus which managed a detection rate of 68.  137  According to the ZeuS tracker website the average detection rate for all variants of the wellknown ZeuS trojan is as low as 40.  138  The problem is magnified by the changing intent of virus authors. Some years ago it was obvious when a virus infection was present. At the time viruses were written by amateurs and exhibited destructive behavior or popups . Modern viruses are often written by professionals financed by criminal organizations .  139  In 2008 Eva Chen  CEO of Trend Micro  stated that the antivirus industry has overhyped how effective its products areand so has been misleading customersfor years.  140  Independent testing on all the major virus scanners consistently shows that none provides 100 virus detection. The best ones provided as high as 99.9 detection for simulated realworld situations while the lowest provided 91.1 in tests conducted in August 2013. Many virus scanners produce false positive results as well identifying benign files as malware.  141  Although methods may differ some notable independent quality testing agencies include AVComparatives  ICSA Labs  SE Labs  West Coast Labs Virus Bulletin  AVTEST and other members of the AntiMalware Testing Standards Organization .  142   143  New viruses  edit  Antivirus programs are not always effective against new viruses even those that use nonsignaturebased methods that should detect new viruses. The reason for this is that the virus designers test their new viruses on the major antivirus applications to make sure that they are not detected before releasing them into the wild.  144  Some new viruses particularly ransomware  use polymorphic code to avoid detection by virus scanners. Jerome Segura a security analyst with ParetoLogic explained  145  Its something that they miss a lot of the time because this type of ransomware virus comes from sites that use a polymorphism which means they basically randomize the file they send you and it gets by wellknown antivirus products very easily. Ive seen people firsthand getting infected having all the popups and yet they have antivirus software running and its not detecting anything. It actually can be pretty hard to get rid of as well and youre never really sure if its really gone. When we see something like that usually we advise to reinstall the operating system or reinstall backups.  145  A proof of concept virus has used the Graphics Processing Unit GPU to avoid detection from antivirus software. The potential success of this involves bypassing the CPU in order to make it much harder for security researchers to analyse the inner workings of such malware.  146  Rootkits  edit  Detecting rootkits is a major challenge for antivirus programs. Rootkits have full administrative access to the computer and are invisible to users and hidden from the list of running processes in the task manager . Rootkits can modify the inner workings of the operating system and tamper with antivirus programs.  147  Damaged files  edit  If a file has been infected by a computer virus antivirus software will attempt to remove the virus code from the file during disinfection but it is not always able to restore the file to its undamaged state.  148   149  In such circumstances damaged files can only be restored from existing backups or shadow copies this is also true for ransomware  150   installed software that is damaged requires reinstallation  151  however see System File Checker . Firmware infections  edit  Any writeable firmware in the computer can be infected by malicious code.  152  This is a major concern as an infected BIOS could require the actual BIOS chip to be replaced to ensure the malicious code is completely removed.  153  Antivirus software is not effective at protecting firmware and the motherboard BIOS from infection.  154  In 2014 security researchers discovered that USB devices contain writeable firmware which can be modified with malicious code dubbed  BadUSB  which antivirus software cannot detect or prevent. The malicious code can run undetected on the computer and could even infect the operating system prior to it booting up.  155   156  Performance and other drawbacks  edit  Antivirus software has some drawbacks first of which that it can impact a computers performance .  157  Furthermore inexperienced users can be lulled into a false sense of security when using the computer considering their computers to be invulnerable and may have problems understanding the prompts and decisions that antivirus software presents them with. An incorrect decision may lead to a security breach. If the antivirus software employs heuristic detection it must be finetuned to minimize misidentifying harmless software as malicious  false positive .  158  Antivirus software itself usually runs at the highly trusted kernel level of the operating system to allow it access to all the potential malicious process and files creating a potential avenue of attack .  159  The US National Security Agency NSA and the UK Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ intelligence agencies 
respectively have been exploiting antivirus software to spy on users.  160  Antivirus software has highly privileged and trusted access to the underlying operating system which makes it a much more appealing target for remote attacks.  161  Additionally antivirus software is years behind securityconscious clientside applications like browsers or document readers. It means that Acrobat Reader Microsoft Word or Google Chrome are harder to exploit than 90 percent of the antivirus products out there according to Joxean Koret a researcher with Coseinc a Singaporebased information security consultancy.  161  Alternative solutions  edit  The commandline virus scanner of Clam AV 0.95.2 running a virus signature definition update scanning a file and identifying a Trojan Antivirus software running on individual computers is the most common method employed of guarding against malware but it is not the only solution. Other solutions can also be employed by users including Unified Threat Management  UTM  hardware and network firewalls Cloudbased antivirus and online scanners. Hardware and network firewall  edit  Network firewalls prevent unknown programs and processes from accessing the system. However they are not antivirus systems and make no attempt to identify or remove anything. They may protect against infection from outside the protected computer or network  and limit the activity of any malicious software which is present by blocking incoming or outgoing requests on certain TCPIP ports. A firewall is designed to deal with broader system threats that come from network connections into the system and is not an alternative to a virus protection system. Cloud antivirus  edit  Cloud antivirus is a technology that uses lightweight agent software on the protected computer while offloading the majority of data analysis to the providers infrastructure.  162  One approach to implementing cloud antivirus involves scanning suspicious files using multiple antivirus engines. This approach was proposed by an early implementation of the cloud antivirus concept called CloudAV. CloudAV was designed to send programs or documents to a network cloud where multiple antivirus and behavioral detection programs are used simultaneously in order to improve detection rates. Parallel scanning of files using potentially incompatible antivirus scanners is achieved by spawning a virtual machine per detection engine and therefore eliminating any possible issues. CloudAV can also perform retrospective detection whereby the cloud detection engine rescans all files in its file access history when a new threat is identified thus improving new threat detection speed. Finally CloudAV is a solution for effective virus scanning on devices that lack the computing power to perform the scans themselves.  163  Some examples of cloud antivirus products are Panda Cloud Antivirus and Immunet . Comodo Group has also produced cloudbased antivirus.  164   165  Online scanning  edit  Some antivirus vendors maintain websites with free online scanning capability of the entire computer critical areas only local disks folders or files. Periodic online scanning is a good idea for those that run antivirus applications on their computers because those applications are frequently slow to catch threats. One of the first things that malicious software does in an attack is disable any existing antivirus software and sometimes the only way to know of an attack is by turning to an online resource that is not installed on the infected computer.  166  Specialized tools  edit  The commandline rkhunter scanner is an engine to scan for Linux rootkits running on Ubuntu . Virus removal tools are available to help remove stubborn infections or a certain type of infection. Examples include Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool   167  Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool   168  and Sophos Scan  Clean .  169  It is also worth noting that sometimes antivirus software can produce a falsepositive result indicating an infection where there is none.  170  A rescue disk that is bootable such as a CD or USB storage device can be used to run antivirus software outside of the installed operating system in order to remove infections while they are dormant. A bootable rescue disk can be useful when for example the installed operating system is no longer bootable or has malware that is resisting all attempts to be removed by the installed antivirus software. Examples of software that can be used on a bootable rescue disk include the Kaspersky Rescue Disk   171  Trend Micro Rescue Disk   172  and Comodo Rescue Disk .  173  Usage and risks  edit  According to an FBI survey major businesses lose 12 million annually dealing with virus incidents.  174  A survey by Symantec in 2009 found that a third of small to mediumsized business did not use antivirus protection at that time whereas more than 80 of home users had some kind of antivirus installed.  175  According to a sociological survey conducted by G Data Software in 2010 49 of women did not use any antivirus program at all.  176  See also  edit  Antivirus and antimalware software CARO  the Computer Antivirus Research Organization Comparison of antivirus software Comparison of computer viruses EICAR  the European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research Endpoint detection and response Firewall software Internet security Linux malware Quarantine antivirus program Sandbox computer security Timeline of computer viruses and worms Virus hoax Citations  edit   What is antivirus software .
