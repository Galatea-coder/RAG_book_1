Network  ARPANET  was the first widearea packetswitched network with distributed control and one of the first computer networks to implement the TCPIP protocol suite. Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet . The ARPANET was established by the Advanced Research Projects Agency now DARPA of the United States Department of Defense .  1  Building on the ideas of J. C. R. Licklider  Bob Taylor initiated the ARPANET project in 1966 to enable resource sharing between remote computers.  2  Taylor appointed Larry Roberts as program manager. Roberts made the key decisions about the request for proposal to build the network.  3  He incorporated Donald Davies  concepts and designs for packet switching  4   5  and sought input from Paul Baran on dynamic routing.  6  In 1969 ARPA awarded the contract to build the Interface Message Processors IMPs for the network to Bolt Beranek  Newman BBN.  7   8  The design was led by Bob Kahn who developed the first protocol for the network. Roberts engaged Leonard Kleinrock at UCLA to develop mathematical methods for analyzing the packet network technology.  6  The first computers were connected in 1969 and the Network Control Protocol was implemented in 1970 development of which was led by Steve Crocker at UCLA and other graduate students including Jon Postel and others.  9   10   11  The network was declared operational in 1971. Further software development enabled remote login and file transfer  which was used to provide an early form of email .  12  The network expanded rapidly and operational control passed to the Defense Communications Agency in 1975. Bob Kahn moved to DARPA and together with Vint Cerf at Stanford University  formulated the Transmission Control Program for internetworking .  13  As this work progressed a protocol was developed by which multiple separate networks could be joined into a network of networks this incorporated concepts pioneered in the French CYCLADES project directed by Louis Pouzin . Version 4 of TCPIP was installed in the ARPANET for production use in January 1983 after the Department of Defense made it standard for all military computer networking.  14   15  Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when the National Science Foundation NSF funded the Computer Science Network CSNET. In the early 1980s the NSF funded the establishment of national supercomputing centers at several universities and provided network access and network interconnectivity with the NSFNET project in 1986. The ARPANET was formally decommissioned in 1990 after partnerships with the telecommunication and computer industry had assured private sector expansion and commercialization of an expanded worldwide network known as the Internet.  16  History  edit  Inspiration  edit  Historically voice and data communications were based on methods of circuit switching  as exemplified in the traditional telephone network wherein each telephone call is allocated a dedicated endtoend electronic connection between the two communicating stations. The connection is established by switching systems that connected multiple intermediate call legs between these systems for the duration of the call. The traditional model of the circuitswitched telecommunication network was challenged in the early 1960s by Paul Baran at the RAND Corporation  who had been researching systems that could sustain operation during partial destruction such as by nuclear war. He developed the theoretical model of distributed adaptive message block switching .  17  However the telecommunication establishment rejected the development in favor of existing models. Donald Davies at the United Kingdoms National Physical Laboratory NPL independently arrived at a similar concept in 1965.  18   19  The earliest ideas for a computer network intended to allow general communications among computer users were formulated by computer scientist J. C. R. Licklider of Bolt Beranek and Newman BBN in April 1963 in memoranda discussing the concept of the  Intergalactic Computer Network . Those ideas encompassed many of the features of the contemporary Internet. In October 1963 Licklider was appointed head of the Behavioral Sciences and Command and Control programs at the Defense Departments Advanced Research Projects Agency ARPA. He convinced Ivan Sutherland and Bob Taylor that this network concept was very important and merited development although Licklider left ARPA before any contracts were assigned for development.  20  Sutherland and Taylor continued their interest in creating the network in part to allow ARPAsponsored researchers at various corporate and academic locales to utilize computers provided by ARPA and in part to quickly distribute new software and other computer science results.  21  Taylor had three computer terminals in his office each connected to separate computers which ARPA was funding one for the System Development Corporation SDC Q32 in Santa Monica  one for Project Genie at the University of California Berkeley  and another for Multics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Taylor recalls the circumstance For each of these three terminals I had three different sets of user commands. So if I was talking online with someone at S.D.C. and I wanted to talk to someone I knew at Berkeley or M.I.T. about this I had to get up from the S.D.C. terminal go over and log into the other terminal and get in touch with them. I said Oh Man its obvious what to do If you have these three terminals there ought to be one terminal that goes anywhere you want to go. That idea is the ARPANET.  22  Donald Davies work caught the attention of ARPANET developers at Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in October 1967.  23  He gave the first public presentation having coined the term packet switching  in August 1968 and incorporated it into the NPL network in England.  24   25  The NPL network and ARPANET were the first two networks in the world to implement packet switching.  26   27   28  Roberts said the computer networks built in the 1970s were similar in nearly all respects to Davies original 1965 design.  29  Creation  edit  In February 1966 Bob Taylor successfully lobbied ARPAs Director Charles M. Herzfeld to fund a network project. Herzfeld redirected funds in the amount of one million dollars from a ballistic missile defense program to Taylors budget.  30  Taylor hired Larry Roberts as a program manager in the ARPA Information Processing Techniques Office in January 1967 to work on the ARPANET.  31  Roberts met Paul Baran in February 1967 but did not discuss networks.  32   33  Roberts asked Frank Westervelt to explore the questions of message size and contents for the network and to write a position paper on the intercomputer communication protocol including conventions for character and block transmission error checking and retransmission and computer and user identification.  31  In April 1967 ARPA held a design session on technical standards. The initial standards for identification and authentication of users transmission of characters and error checking and retransmission procedures were discussed.  34  Roberts proposal was that all mainframe computers would connect to one another directly. The other investigators were reluctant to dedicate these computing resources to network administration. After the design session Wesley Clark proposed minicomputers should be used as an interface to create a message switching network. Roberts modified the ARPANET plan to incorporate Clarks suggestion and named the minicomputers Interface Message Processors IMPs.  31   35   36   37  The plan was presented at the inaugural Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in October 1967.  38  Donald Davies work on packet switching and the NPL network presented by a colleague  Roger Scantlebury  and that of Paul Baran came to the attention of the ARPA investigators at this conference.  39   23  Roberts applied Davies concept of packet switching for the ARPANET  40   41  and sought input from Paul Baran on dynamic routing.  42  The NPL network was using line speeds of 768 kbits and the proposed line speed for the ARPANET was upgraded from 2.4 kbits to 50 kbits.  43  By mid1968 Roberts and Barry Wessler wrote a final version of the IMP specification based on a Stanford Research Institute SRI report that ARPA commissioned to write detailed specifications describing the ARPANET communications network.  37  Roberts gave a report to Taylor on 3 June who approved it on 21 June. After approval by ARPA a Request for Quotation RFQ was issued for 140 potential bidders. Most computer science companies regarded the ARPA proposal as outlandish and only twelve submitted bids to build a network of the twelve ARPA regarded only four as toprank contractors. At years end ARPA considered only two contractors and awarded the contract to build the network to BBN in January 1969.  26  1969 ARPANET IMP The initial sevenperson BBN team were much aided by the technical specificity of their response to the ARPA RFQ and thus quickly produced the first working system. The IMP guys were led by Frank Heart  the theoretical design of the network was led by Bob Kahn  the team included Dave Walden  Severo Ornstein  William Crowther and several others.  44   45   46  The BBNproposed network closely followed Roberts ARPA plan a network composed of small computers the IMPs similar to the later concept of routers  that functioned as gateways interconnecting local resources. Routing flow control software design and network control were developed by the BBN team.  44   47  At each site the IMPs performed storeandforward packet switching functions and were interconnected with leased lines via telecommunication data sets  modems  with initial data rates of 50 kbit s .  43   48   49  The host computers were connected to the IMPs via custom serial communication interfaces. The system including the hardware and the packet switching software was designed and installed in nine months.  26   37   50  The BBN team continued to interact with the NPL team with meetings between them taking place in the U.S. and the U.K.  51   52   53  As with the NPL network the firstgeneration IMPs were built by BBN using a rugged computer version of the Honeywell DDP516 computer configured with 24 KB of expandable magneticcore memory  and a 16channel Direct Multiplex Control DMC direct memory access unit.  54  The DMC established custom interfaces with each of the host computers and modems. In addition to the frontpanel lamps the DDP516 computer also features a special set of 24 indicator lamps showing the status of the IMP communication channels. Each IMP could support up to four local hosts and could communicate with up to six remote IMPs via early Digital Signal 0 leased telephone lines. The network connected one computer in Utah with three in California. Later the Department of Defense allowed the universities to join the network for sharing hardware and software resources. Debate about design goals  edit  According to Charles Herzfeld ARPA Director 19651967 The ARPANET was not started to create a Command and Control System that would survive a nuclear attack as many now claim. To build such a system was clearly a major military need but it was not ARPAs mission to do this in fact we would have been severely criticized had we tried. Rather the ARPANET came out of our frustration that there were only a limited number of large powerful research computers in the country and that many research investigators who should have access to them were geographically separated from them.  55  The ARPANET used distributed computation and incorporated frequent recomputation of routing tables automatic routing was technically challenging at the time. These features increased the survivability of the network in the event of significant interruption. Furthermore the ARPANET was designed to survive subordinate network losses.  56   57  However the Internet Society agrees with Herzfeld in a footnote in their online article A Brief History of the Internet  It was from the RAND study that the false rumor started claiming that the ARPANET was somehow related to building a network resistant to nuclear war. This was never true of the ARPANET but was an aspect of the earlier RAND study of secure communication. The later work on internetworking did emphasize robustness and survivability including the capability to withstand losses of large portions of the underlying networks.  58  Paul Baran  the first to put forward a theoretical model for communication using packet switching conducted the RAND study referenced above.  59   17  Though the ARPANET did not exactly share Barans projects goal he said his work did contribute to the development of the ARPANET.  60  Minutes taken by Elmer Shapiro of Stanford Research Institute at the ARPANET design meeting of 910 October 1967 indicate that a version of Barans routing method hot potato may be used  61  consistent with the NPL teams proposal at the Symposium on Operating System Principles in Gatlinburg.  62  Later in the 1970s ARPA did emphasize the goal of command and control. According to Stephen J. Lukasik  who was deputy director 19671970 and Director of DARPA 19701975  63  The goal was to exploit new computer technologies to meet the needs of military command and control against nuclear threats achieve survivable control of US nuclear forces and improve military tactical and management decision making.  64  Implementation  edit  The first four nodes were designated as a testbed for developing and debugging the 1822 protocol  which was a major undertaking. While they were connected electronically in 1969 network applications were not possible until the Network Control Protocol was implemented in 1970 enabling the first two hosthost protocols remote login  Telnet  and file transfer  FTP  which were specified and implemented between 1969 and 1973.  10   11   65  The network was declared operational in 1971. Network traffic began to grow once email was established at the majority of sites by around 1973.  12  Initial four hosts  edit  First ARPANET IMP log the first message ever sent via the ARPANET 1030 pm PST on 29 October 1969 630 UTC on 30 October 1969. This IMP Log excerpt kept at UCLA describes setting up a message transmission from the UCLA SDS Sigma 7 Host computer to the SRI SDS 940 Host computer. The initial ARPANET configuration linked UCLA  ARC  UCSB  and the University of Utah School of Computing . The first node was created at UCLA where Leonard Kleinrock could evaluate network performance and examine his theories on message delay .  66   67   68  The locations were selected not only to reduce leased line costs but also because each had specific expertise beneficial for this initial implementation phase  1  University of California Los Angeles UCLA where Kleinrock had established a Network Measurement Center NMC with an SDS Sigma 7 being the first computer attached to it The Augmentation Research Center at Stanford Research Institute now SRI International  where Douglas Engelbart had created the new NLS system an early hypertext system and would run the Network Information Center NIC with the SDS 940 that ran NLS named Genie being the first host attached University of California Santa Barbara UCSB with the Culler Fried Interactive Mathematics Centers IBM 36075  running OSMVT being the machine attached A sketch of the ARPANET in December 1969. The nodes at UCLA and the Stanford Research Institute SRI are among those depicted. The University of Utah School of Computing  where Ivan Sutherland had moved running a DEC PDP10 operating on TENEX . The first successful hosttohost connection on the ARPANET was made between Stanford Research Institute SRI and UCLA by SRI programmer Bill Duvall and UCLA student programmer Charley Kline at 1030 pm PST on 29 October 1969 630 UTC on 30 October 1969.  69  Kline connected from UCLAs SDS Sigma 7 Host computer in Boelter Hall room 3420 to the Stanford Research Institutes SDS 940 Host computer. Kline typed the command login but initially the SDS 940 crashed after he typed two characters. About an hour later after Duvall adjusted parameters on the machine Kline tried again and successfully logged in. Hence the first two characters successfully transmitted over the ARPANET were lo.  70   71   72  The first permanent ARPANET link was established on 21 November 1969 between the IMP at UCLA and the IMP at the Stanford Research Institute. By 5 December 1969 the initial fournode network was established. Elizabeth Feinler created the first Resource Handbook for ARPANET in 1969 which led to the development of the ARPANET directory.  73  The directory built by Feinler and a team made it possible to navigate the ARPANET.  74   75  Network performance  edit  In 1968 Roberts contracted with Kleinrock to measure the performance of the network and find areas for improvement.  42   76   77  Building on his earlier work on queueing theory and optimization of packet delay in communication networks Kleinrock specified mathematical models of the performance of packetswitched networks which underpinned the development of the ARPANET as it expanded rapidly in the early 1970s.  26   39   42  Growth and evolution  edit  ARPA network map 1973 Roberts engaged Howard Frank to consult on the topological design of the network. Frank made recommendations to increase throughput and reduce costs in a scaledup network.  78  By March 1970 the ARPANET reached the East Coast of the United States when an IMP at BBN in Cambridge Massachusetts was connected to the network. Thereafter the ARPANET grew 9 IMPs by June 1970 and 13 IMPs by December 1970 then 18 by September 1971 when the network included 23 university and government hosts 29 IMPs by August 1972 and 40 by September 1973. By June 1974 there were 46 IMPs and in July 1975 the network numbered 57 IMPs. By 1981 the number was 213 host computers with another host connecting approximately every twenty days.  1  Support for interIMP circuits of up to 230.4 kbits was added in 1970 although considerations of cost and IMP processing power meant this capability was not actively used. Larry Roberts saw the ARPANET and NPL projects as complementary and sought in 1970 to connect them via a satellite link. Peter Kirstein s research group at University College London UCL was subsequently chosen in 1971 in place of NPL for the UK connection. In June 1973 a transatlantic satellite link connected ARPANET to the Norwegian Seismic Array NORSAR  79  via the Tanum Earth Station in Sweden and onward via a terrestrial circuit to a TIP at UCL. UCL provided a gateway for interconnection of the ARPANET with British academic networks the first international resource sharing network and carried out some of the earliest experimental research work on internetworking.  80  1971 saw the start of the use of the nonruggedized and therefore significantly lighter Honeywell 316 as an IMP. It could also be configured as a Terminal Interface Processor TIP which provided terminal server support for up to 63 ASCII serial terminals through a multiline controller in place of one of the hosts.  81  The 316 featured a greater degree of integration than the 516 which made it less expensive and easier to maintain. The 316 was configured with 40 kB of core memory for a TIP. The size of core memory was later increased to 32 kB for the IMPs and 56 kB for TIPs in 1973. The ARPANET was demonstrated at the International Conference on Computer Communications in October 1972. In 1975 BBN introduced IMP software running on the Pluribus multiprocessor . These appeared in a few sites. In 1981 BBN introduced IMP software running on its own C30 processor product. Operation  edit  ARPA was intended to fund advanced research. The ARPANET was a research project that was communicationsoriented rather than useroriented in design.  82  Nonetheless in the summer of 1975 operational control of the ARPANET passed to the Defense Communications Agency .  1  At about this time the first ARPANET encryption devices were deployed to support classified traffic. The ARPANET Completion Report  written in 1978 and published in 1981 jointly by BBN and DARPA   83  concludes that ... it is somewhat fitting to end on the note that the ARPANET program has had a strong and direct feedback into the support and strength of computer science from which the network itself sprang.  84  CSNET expansion  edit  Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when the National Science Foundation NSF funded the Computer Science Network CSNET. Adoption of TCPIP  edit  Internetworking demonstration linking the ARPANET PRNET  and SATNET in 1977 The transatlantic connectivity with NORSAR and UCL later evolved into the SATNET . The ARPANET SATNET and PRNET were interconnected in 1977. The DoD made TCPIP the standard communication protocol for all military computer networking in 1980.  85  NORSAR and University College London left the ARPANET and began using TCPIP over SATNET in 1982.  86  On January 1 1983 known as flag day  TCPIP protocols became the standard for the ARPANET replacing the earlier Network Control Protocol.  87   15  MILNET phasing out  edit  In September 1984 work was completed on restructuring the ARPANET giving U.S. military sites their own Military Network  MILNET  for unclassified defense department communications.  88   89  Both networks carried unclassified information and were connected at a small number of controlled gateways which would allow total separation in the event of an emergency. MILNET was part of the Defense Data Network DDN.  90  Separating the civil and military networks reduced the 113node ARPANET by 68 nodes. After MILNET was split away the ARPANET would continue to be used as an Internet backbone for researchers but be slowly phased out. Decommissioning  edit  In 1985 the NSF funded the establishment of national supercomputing centers at several universities and provided network access and network interconnectivity with the NSFNET project in 1986. NSFNET became the Internet backbone for government agencies and universities. The ARPANET project was formally decommissioned in 1990. The original IMPs and TIPs were phased out as the ARPANET was shut down after the introduction of the NSFNet but some IMPs remained in service as late as July 1990.  91   92  In the wake of the decommissioning of the ARPANET on 28 February 1990 Vinton Cerf wrote the following lamentation entitled Requiem of the ARPANET  93  It was the first and being first was best but now we lay it down to ever rest. Now pause with me a moment shed some tears. For auld lang syne  for love for years and years of faithful service duty done I weep. Lay down thy packet  now O friend and sleep.  Vinton Cerf Legacy  edit  ARPANET and related projects. Figure from 1990.  94  The technological advancements and practical applications achieved through the ARPANET were instrumental in shaping modern computer networking including the Internet . Development and implementation of the concepts of packet switching decentralized networks and communication protocols notably TCPIP laid the foundation for a global network that revolutionized communication information sharing and collaborative research across the world.  95  The ARPANET was related to many other research projects which either influenced the ARPANET design were ancillary projects or spun out of the ARPANET. Senator Al Gore authored the High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991  commonly referred to as The Gore Bill after hearing the 1988 concept for a National Research Network submitted to Congress by a group chaired by Leonard Kleinrock . The bill was passed on 9 December 1991 and led to the National Information Infrastructure NII which Gore called the information superhighway . The ARPANET project was honored with two IEEE Milestones  both dedicated in 2009.  96   97  Software and protocols  edit  This section needs additional citations for verification .

October 2022   Learn how and when to remove this message  IMP functionality  edit  Because it was never a goal for the ARPANET to support IMPs from vendors other than BBN the IMPtoIMP protocol and message format were not standardized. However the IMPs did nonetheless communicate amongst themselves to perform linkstate routing  to do reliable forwarding of messages and to provide remote monitoring and management functions to ARPANETs Network Control Center. Initially each IMP had a 6bit identifier and supported up to 4 hosts which were identified with a 2bit index. An ARPANET host address therefore consisted of both the port index on its IMP and the identifier of the IMP which was written with either portIMP notation or as a single byte for example the address of MITDMG notable for hosting development of Zork  could be written as either 16 or 70 . An upgrade in early 1976 extended the host and IMP numbering to 8bit and 16bit respectively.  citation needed  In addition to primary routing and forwarding responsibilities the IMP ran several background programs titled TTY DEBUG PARAMETERCHANGE DISCARD TRACE and STATISTICS. These were given host numbers in order to be addressed directly and provided functions independently of any connected host. For example TTY allowed an onsite operator to send ARPANET packets manually via the teletype connected directly to the IMP.  citation needed  1822 protocol  edit  The starting point for hosttohost communication on the ARPANET in 1969 was the 1822 protocol  which defined the transmission of messages to an IMP.  98  The message format was designed to work unambiguously with a broad range of computer architectures. An 1822 message essentially consisted of a message type a numeric host address and a data field. To send a data message to another host the transmitting host formatted a data message containing the destination hosts address and the data message being sent and then transmitted the message through the 1822 hardware interface. The IMP then delivered the message to its destination address either by delivering it to a locally connected host or by delivering it to another IMP. When the message was ultimately delivered to the destination host the receiving IMP would transmit a Ready for Next Message RFNM acknowledgment to the sending host IMP.  citation needed  Network Control Protocol  edit  Unlike modern Internet datagrams the ARPANET was designed to reliably transmit 1822 messages and to inform the host computer when it loses a message the contemporary IP is unreliable whereas the TCP is reliable. Nonetheless the 1822 protocol proved inadequate for handling multiple connections among different applications residing in a host computer. This problem was addressed with the Network Control Protocol NCP which provided a standard method to establish reliable flowcontrolled bidirectional communications links among different processes in different host computers. The NCP interface allowed application software to connect across the ARPANET by implementing higherlevel communication protocols  an early example of the protocol layering concept later incorporated in the OSI model .  65  NCP was developed under the leadership of Steve Crocker  then a graduate student at UCLA. Crocker created and led the Network Working Group NWG which was made up of a collection of graduate students at universities and research laboratories including Jon Postel and Vint Cerf at UCLA. They were sponsored by ARPA to carry out the development of the ARPANET and the software for the host computers that supported applications. Network applications  edit  NCP provided a standard set of network services that could be shared by several applications running on a single host computer. This led to the evolution of application protocols that operated more or less independently of the underlying network service and permitted independent advances in the underlying protocols.  citation needed  The various application protocols such as TELNET for remote timesharing access and File Transfer Protocol FTP the latter used to enable rudimentary electronic mail were developed and eventually ported to run over the TCPIP protocol suite. In the 1980s FTP for email was replaced by the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol and later POP and IMAP .  citation needed  Telnet was developed in 1969 beginning with RFC 15 extended in RFC 855.  citation needed  The original specification for the File Transfer Protocol was written by Abhay Bhushan and published as RFC 114 on 16 April 1971. By 1973 the File Transfer Protocol FTP specification had been defined  RFC 354  and implemented enabling file transfers over the ARPANET.  citation needed  In 1971 Ray Tomlinson  of BBN sent the first network email  RFC 524  RFC 561 .  12   99  An ARPA study in 1973 a year after network email was introduced to the ARPANET community found that threequarters of the traffic over the ARPANET consisted of email messages.  100   101   102  Email remained a very large part of the overall ARPANET traffic.  103  The Network Voice Protocol NVP specifications were defined in 1977  RFC 741  and implemented. But because of technical shortcomings conference calls over the ARPANET never worked well the contemporary Voice over Internet Protocol packet voice was decades away.  citation needed  TCPIP  edit  Stephen J. Lukasik directed DARPA to focus on internetworking research in the early 1970s. Bob Kahn moved from BBN to DARPA in 1972 first as program manager for the ARPANET under Larry Roberts then as director of the IPTO when Roberts left to found Telenet . Kahn worked on both satellite packet networks and groundbased radio packet networks and recognized the value of being able to communicate across both. Steve Crocker now at DARPA and the leaders of British and French network projects founded the International Network Working Group in 1972 and on Crockers recommendation Vint Cerf  now on the faculty at Stanford University  became its Chair.  104   105   106  This group considered how to interconnect packet switching networks with different specifications that is internetworking . Research led by Kahn and Cerf resulted in the formulation of the Transmission Control Program   13  which incorporated concepts from the French CYCLADES project directed by Louis Pouzin .  107  Its specification was written by Cerf with Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine at Stanford in December 1974  RFC 675 . The following year testing began through concurrent implementations at Stanford BBN and University College London .  86  At first a monolithic design the software was redesigned as a modular protocol stack in version 3 in 1978. Version 4 was installed in the ARPANET for production use in January 1983 replacing NCP. The development of the complete Internet protocol suite by 1989 as outlined in RFC 1122 and RFC 1123  and partnerships with the telecommunication and computer industry laid the foundation for the adoption of TCPIP as a comprehensive protocol suite as the core component of the emerging Internet .  15  Password protection  edit  The Purdy Polynomial hash algorithm was developed for the ARPANET to protect passwords in 1971 at the request of Larry Roberts head of ARPA at that time. It computed a polynomial of degree 2 24  17 modulo the 64bit prime p  2 64  59. The algorithm was later used by Digital Equipment Corporation DEC to hash passwords in the VMS operating system and is still being used for this purpose.  citation needed  Rules and etiquette  edit  Because of its government funding certain forms of traffic were discouraged or prohibited. Leonard Kleinrock claims to have committed the first illegal act on the Internet having sent a request for return of his electric razor after a meeting in England in 1973. At the time use of the ARPANET for personal reasons was unlawful.  108   109  In 1978 against the rules of the network Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation DEC sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the ARPANET. He claims that this resulted in 13 million worth of sales in DEC products and highlighted the potential of email marketing .  citation needed  A 1982 handbook on computing at MITs AI Lab stated regarding network etiquette  110  It is considered illegal to use the ARPANet for anything which is not in direct support of Government business ... personal messages to other ARPANet subscribers for example to arrange a gettogether or check and say a friendly hello are generally not considered harmful ... Sending electronic mail over the ARPANet for commercial profit or political purposes is both antisocial and illegal. By sending such messages you can offend many people and it is possible to get MIT in serious trouble with the Government agencies which manage the ARPANet.

The artists 2002 album Wireless Internet features commentary on the expansion of the internet via wireless communication with songs such as NTT DoCoMo  dedicated to the mobile communications giant based in Japan.  citation needed  Thomas Pynchon mentions the ARPANET in his 2009 novel Inherent Vice  which is set in Los Angeles in 1970 and in his 2013 novel Bleeding Edge .  113  The 1993 television series The XFiles featured the ARPANET in a season 5 episode titled  Unusual Suspects . John Fitzgerald Byers offers to help Susan Modeski known as Holly ... just like the sugar by hacking into the ARPANET to obtain sensitive information.  114   better source needed  In the spydrama television series The Americans  a Russian scientist defector offers access to ARPANET to the Russians in a plea to not be repatriated Season 2 Episode 5 The Deal. Episode 7 of Season 2 is named ARPANET and features Russian infiltration to bug the network. In the television series Person of Interest  main character Harold Finch hacked the ARPANET in 1980 using a homemade computer during his first efforts to build a prototype of the Machine.  115   116  This corresponds with the real life virus that occurred in October of that year that temporarily halted ARPANET functions.  117  The ARPANET hack was first discussed in the episode 2PiR stylized 2 π displaystyle pi  R  where a computer science teacher called it the most famous hack in history and one that was never solved. Finch later mentioned it to Person of Interest Caleb Phipps and his role was first indicated when he showed knowledge that it was done by a kid with a homemade computer which Phipps who had researched the hack had never heard before. In the third season of the television series Halt and Catch Fire  the character Joe MacMillan explores the potential commercialization of the ARPANET.

In the early 1970s Mr Pouzin created an innovative data network that linked locations in France Italy and Britain. Its simplicity and efficiency pointed the way to a network that could connect not just dozens of machines but millions of them. It captured the imagination of Dr Cerf and Dr Kahn who included aspects of its design in the protocols that now power the internet.  TALKING HEADERS . Washington Post . 7 January 2024.

The ARPANET was an official federal research facility after all and not something to be toyed with. Kleinrock had the feeling that the stunt hed pulled was slightly out of bounds. It was a thrill.

Focuses on Kahns role in the development of computer networking from 1967 through the early 1980s. Beginning with his work at BBN Kahn discusses his involvement as the ARPANET proposal was being written and then implemented and his role in the public demonstration of the ARPANET. The interview continues into Kahns involvement with networking when he moves to IPTO in 1972 where he was responsible for the administrative and technical evolution of the ARPANET including programs in packet radio the development of a new network protocol TCPIP and the switch to TCPIP to connect multiple networks.
