A member of the Portuguese Socialist Party  Guterres served as prime minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002. Guterres served as secretarygeneral of the Socialist Party from 1992 to 2002. He was elected prime minister in 1995 and announced his resignation in 2002 after his party was defeated in the 2001 Portuguese local elections . After six years governing without an absolute majority and with a poor economy the Socialist Party did worse than expected because of losses in Lisbon and Porto  where polls indicated they had a solid lead. Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues assumed the Socialist Party leadership in January 2002 but Guterres would remain as prime minister until the general election was lost to the Social Democratic Party  led by José Manuel Barroso . Despite this defeat polling of the Portuguese public in both 2012 and 2014 ranked Guterres the best prime minister of the previous 30 years.  3   4  Guterres served as President of the Socialist International from 1999 to 2005 and was the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from 2005 to 2015.  5  Guterres was elected secretarygeneral in October 2016  succeeding Ban Kimoon at the beginning of the following year and becoming the first European to hold this office since Kurt Waldheim in 1981. Early life education and early career  edit  Guterres was born in parish of SantosoVelho  in the municipality of Lisbon  Portugal  the son of Virgílio Dias Guterres 19132009 and Ilda Cândida dos Reis Oliveira Guterres 19232021.  6  He attended the Camões Lyceum now Camões Secondary School  where he graduated in 1965 winning the National Lyceums Award  Prémio Nacional dos Liceus  as the best student in the country.  citation needed  He studied physics and electrical engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico  Technical University of Lisbon in Lisbon. He graduated in 1971 and started an academic career as an assistant professor teaching systems theory and telecommunications signals  before leaving academic life to start a political career.  7  During his university years he joined the Group of Light a club for young Catholics where he met Father Vítor Melícias  a prominent Franciscan priest and church administrator who remains a close friend and confidant.  8  Political career  edit  Guterress political career began in 1974 when he became a member of the Socialist Party . Shortly thereafter he quit academic life and became a fulltime politician. In the period following the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974 that put an end to Caetanos dictatorship  Guterres became involved in Socialist Party leadership and held the following offices Head of Office of the Secretary of State of Industry 1974 and 1975  9  Deputy for Castelo Branco in the Portuguese National Parliament 19762002  10  Leader of the parliamentary bench of the Socialist Party succeeding Jorge Sampaio 19891990  11  Guterres was a member of the team that negotiated the terms of Portugals entry into the European Union in the late 1970s.  12  He was a founding member of the Portuguese Refugee Council  clarification needed  in 1991.  13  In 1992 after the Socialists third consecutive defeat in Parliamentary elections   14  Guterres became secretarygeneral of the Socialist Party and leader of the opposition during Aníbal Cavaco Silva s government.  15  At the time he was the partys third leader in six years.  16  He was also selected as one of the 25 vice presidents of the Socialist International in September 1992.  17  His election represented a break with tradition for the Socialists not only was Guterres not associated with either the faction around thenpresident and former prime minister Mário Soares or the partys left wing led by Guterress predecessor Sampaio but he was also a devout Catholic running counter to the partys historical secularism. He consulted with Portugals civil society in formulating policy meeting a range of intellectuals scientists and entrepreneurs from across the country and the political spectrum in the runup to the next general election.  14  Prime minister of Portugal  edit  Aníbal Cavaco Silva did not seek a fourth term as prime minister of Portugal in order to run for the 1996 presidential election  and the Socialist Party won the 1995 parliamentary election . President Soares appointed Guterres as prime minister  18  and his cabinet took the oath of office on 28 October that year. Guterres ran on a platform of keeping a tight hold on budget spending and inflation in a bid to ensure that Portugal met the Euro convergence criteria by the end of the decade as well as increasing rates of participation in the labor market especially among women improving tax collection and cracking down on tax evasion increased involvement of the mutual and nonprofit sectors in providing welfare services a meanstested guaranteed minimum income known as the Rendimento Mínimo Garantido  and increased investment in education.  14  He was then one of seven Social Democratic prime ministers in the European Union joining political allies in Spain Denmark Finland Sweden Greece and the Netherlands.  19  First term 19951999  edit  Main article XIII Constitutional Government of Portugal Guterres and Prime Minister of Spain Felipe González  in January 1996. With a style markedly different from that of his predecessor and based on dialogue and discussion with all sections of society Guterres was a popular prime minister in his first years in office. Portugal was enjoying an economic expansion that allowed the Socialists to reduce budget deficits while increasing welfare spending and creating new conditional cash transfer programs.  8  His government also accelerated the program of privatizations that Cavaco Silva s government had begun 29 companies were privatized between 1996 and 1999 with proceeds from privatizations in 199697 greater than those of the previous six years and the public sectors share of GDP halved from 11 in 1994 to 5.5 five years later. Share ownership was also widened with 800000 people investing in Portugal Telecom upon its privatization in 1996 and 750000 applying for shares in Electricidade de Portugal .  14  In 1998 Guterres presided over Expo 98 in Lisbon commemorating the 500th anniversary of the voyage of Vasco da Gama .  20  Also in 1998 two nationwide referendums were held. The first one was held in June and asked voters whether abortion rules should be liberalized. The Socialist Party split over the issue of liberalization and Guterres led the antiabortion side which eventually won the referendum.  8  A second referendum was held in November this time over the regionalization of the mainland . Both Guterres and his party supported such an administrative reform but the voters rejected it. Contrary to his partys stance and following the removal of homosexuality from the list of mental illnesses by the World Health Organization in 1990 Guterres said in 1995 that he did not like homosexuality and that it was something that bothered him.  21  On foreign policy Guterres campaigned for United Nations intervention in East Timor in 1999 after it was virtually destroyed by Indonesianbacked militias when it voted for independence .  13  He also finalized the 12year negotiations on the transfer of sovereignty over Macau  which had been a Portuguese colony  to Chinese control in 1999.  22  Second term 19992002  edit  Main article XIV Constitutional Government of Portugal Guterres in 2003 In the 1999 parliamentary election the Socialist Party and the opposition won exactly the same number of seats 115. Guterres was reappointed to office and from January to July 2000 occupied the sixmonth rotating presidency of the European Council . His second term in government was not as successful however. Internal party conflicts an economic slowdown and the Hintze Ribeiro Bridge disaster damaged his authority and popularity. Nevertheless some longlasting measures were taken during his second term in October 2000 the Parliament approved the decriminalization of drug use effective 1 July 2001  23  and in March 2001 samesex civil unions were legalized.  22   24  In December 2001 following a disastrous defeat for the Socialist Party in local elections Guterres resigned  18  to prevent the country from falling into a political swamp.  25  President Jorge Sampaio dissolved Parliament and called for elections. Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues  until then minister for social security assumed the Socialist Party leadership but the general election was lost to the Social Democratic Party of José Manuel Durão Barroso  who later became president of the European Commission . President of Socialist International  edit  Guterres was elected president of Socialist International in November 1999  26  overlapping with his second term as prime minister of Portugal until his resignation from the latter post in December 2001. He remained president of the Socialist International until June 2005.  26  Diplomatic career  edit  In 2005 following Guterress proposal George Papandreou was elected vice president of the Socialist International  in 2006 Papandreou succeeded him as president of the Socialist International. In May 2005 Guterres was elected High Commissioner for Refugees for a fiveyear term by the UN General Assembly  replacing Ruud Lubbers .  27   26  High Commissioner for Refugees  edit  As High Commissioner Guterres headed one of the worlds largest humanitarian organizations which at the end of his term had more than 10000 staff working in 126 countries providing protection and assistance to over 60 million refugees returnees internally displaced people and stateless persons.  citation needed  His time in office was marked by a fundamental organizational reform cutting staff and administrative costs in the UNHCRs Geneva head office and expanding UNHCRs emergency response capacity during the worst displacement crisis since the Second World War.  28   29  From 19 to 23 March 2006 Guterres visited Beijing  China and expressed his objection to repatriation of North Korean refugees by the Chinese government.  30   31  In a February 2007 NPR interview devoted mainly to the plight of Iraqi refugees Guterres said that this was one of the greatest refugee crises in the Middle East since 1948. Among poorly publicized refugee crises he cited those in the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  32  During his final years as High Commissioner he worked chiefly to secure international aid for the refugees of the Syrian civil war  calling the refugee crisis an existential one for host countries such as Lebanon and Jordan  and calling additional aid a matter of survival for the refugees.  33  He was an outspoken advocate for a more coordinated and humane approach by European countries to the Mediterranean refugee crisis.  34  In June 2013 he launched a US5 billion aid effort its biggest ever to help up to 10.25 million Syrians that year.  35  Guterres 2012 In what was widely considered a very effective PR move Guterres appointed American actress Angelina Jolie as his special envoy to represent UNHCR and himself at the diplomatic level in 2012.  36  Together they visited the Kilis Oncupinar Accommodation Facility in Turkey 2012  37  the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan 2013  38  and the Maritime Squadron of the Armed Forces of Malta 2015. They also appeared jointly before the United Nations Security Council 2015.  39  In early 2015 the General Assembly voted to extend Guterress mandate by 6 1  2 months to 31 December on recommendation of United Nations SecretaryGeneral Ban Kimoon . In light of the European migrant crisis  the UNHCRs 98member executive committee EXCOM later requested that Ban recommend extending Guterress term by another year but Ban disregarded the request.  40  Guterres left office on 31 December 2015 having served the secondlongest term as High Commissioner in the organizations history after Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan .  41  In 2015 President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa appointed Guterres to serve as a Member of the Council of State of Portugal  he resigned after being appointed as the UNs 9th secretarygeneral.  42   43  United Nations secretarygeneral  edit  Candidacy  edit  Main article 2016 United Nations SecretaryGeneral selection Guterres 2016 Guterres became United Nations SecretaryGeneral on 1 January 2017 following his formal election by the UN General Assembly on 13 October 2016.  44  Guterres and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry shake hands 4 November 2016 On 29 February 2016 Guterres submitted his nomination as Portugals candidate for the 2016 UN secretarygeneral selection.  45  This was the first time candidates for secretarygeneral had to present their platform in public hearings in the UN General Assembly a process during which Guterres emerged as a much stronger candidate than had been initially expected given that he fit the bill on neither the gender nor the geographic scores.  46  On 5 October the 15member United Nations Security Council announced that it had agreed to nominate Guterres after an informal secret ballot in which he gained 13 encourage votes and two no opinion votes.  47   48  The Security Council officially nominated Guterres in a formal resolution on 6 October.

SecretaryGeneral.  50  Guterres with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe in Tokyo  Japan 14 December 2017 The UNs role in the Haiti cholera outbreak was widely discussed and criticized  51  after the Ban Kimoon administration denied the issue for several months. According to the Bostonbased Institute for Justice  Democracy in Haiti as well as numerous conclusive scientific studies the UN is the proximate cause for bringing cholera to Haiti . Peacekeepers sent to Haiti from Nepal in 2010 were carrying asymptomatic cholera and failed to treat their waste properly before dumping it into one of Haitis main water streams.  51  During his UNSG informal dialogue Jamaica  on behalf of the Caribbean Community  asked if the UN should assume liability for any deaths within local populations that result from the introduction of infectious disease by its peacekeepers. Jamaica also asked if Guterres believed compensation should be provided.  52  Guterres responded by calling the situation a particularly complex question saying it was difficult to preserve diplomatic immunity while also ensuring there is no impunity but that he would pay a lot of attention in trying to find the right equilibrium between these two aspects that are absolutely crucial.  52  In a UN General Assembly meeting in late October 2016 the representative from Haiti called the UNs current and future response to the cholera epidemic a litmus test of the systems commitment to the promotion of human rights.  53  Though many had hoped Guterress term would mark a break with the inaction that characterized Bans response to the epidemic Guterres has done little to signal a commitment to Haitian cholera victims. As of April 2017 five months into his term as secretarygeneral only 10 million had been contributed to the 400 million fund to fight cholera and provide material assistance to victims the UN announced in 2016.  54  Guterres with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov  24 November 2016 In 2016 Anders Kompass exposed the sexual assault of children by peacekeepers in the Central African Republic and as a consequence was dismissed by Bans administration before being rehabilitated in court.  55  During the United Nations SecretaryGeneral Candidate informal dialogues Guterres indicated it was completely unacceptable that there be UN forces committing human rights violations such as rape and sexual violence. All of us togetherstates and UNmust do our utmost to ensure that any kind of action of this type is severely punished he said.  52  The United States raised the question of international tribunals to try peacekeepers for their crimes. Guterres responded by saying an independent jurisdiction would be excellent but that the only way to get there is through a new compact with all key partiestrue contributors financial contributorsand to make sure that there is an adjustment in the relation between countries the UN and the support those that are contributing with troops receive in order to be able to do it much better.  52  First term  edit  Guterres with U.S. President Donald Trump  2 October 2017 Guterres speaking about artificial intelligence and climate change at the 2024 World Economic Forum On 1 January 2017 on his first day as secretarygeneral of the United Nations Guterres pledged to make 2017 a year for peace.
