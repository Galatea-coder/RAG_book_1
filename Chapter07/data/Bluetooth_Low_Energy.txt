Wireless personal area network technology Bluetooth Low Energy  Bluetooth LE  colloquially BLE  formerly marketed as Bluetooth Smart  1   is a wireless personal area network technology designed and marketed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group Bluetooth SIG  2  aimed at novel applications in the healthcare fitness  beacons   3  security and home entertainment industries.  4  Compared to Classic Bluetooth  Bluetooth Low Energy is intended to provide considerably reduced power consumption and cost while maintaining a similar communication range . It is independent of classic Bluetooth and has no compatibility but Bluetooth Basic RateEnhanced Data Rate BREDR and LE can coexist. The original specification was developed by Nokia in 2006 under the name Wibree  5  which was integrated into Bluetooth 4.0 in December 2009 as Bluetooth Low Energy. Mobile operating systems including iOS  Android  Windows Phone and BlackBerry  as well as macOS  Linux  Windows 8  Windows 10 and Windows 11  natively support Bluetooth Low Energy. Compatibility  edit  Bluetooth Low Energy is distinct from the previous often called classic Bluetooth Basic RateEnhanced Data Rate BREDR protocol but the two protocols can both be supported by one device the Bluetooth 4.0 specification permits devices to implement either or both of the LE and BREDR systems. Bluetooth Low Energy uses the same 2.4 GHz radio frequencies as classic Bluetooth which allows dualmode devices to share a single radio antenna  but uses a simpler modulation system  clarification needed  . Branding  edit  The previously used Bluetooth Smart logo In 2011 the Bluetooth SIG announced the Bluetooth Smart logo so as to clarify compatibility between the new low energy devices and other Bluetooth devices.  6  Bluetooth Smart Ready indicates a dualmode device compatible with both classic and low energy peripherals .  7  Bluetooth Smart indicates a lowenergyonly device which requires either a Smart Ready or another Bluetooth Smart device in order to function. With the May 2016 Bluetooth SIG branding information the Bluetooth SIG began phasing out the Bluetooth Smart and Bluetooth Smart Ready logos and word marks and reverted to using the Bluetooth logo and word mark  8  in a new blue colour. Target market  edit  The Bluetooth SIG identifies a number of markets for lowenergy technology particularly in the smart home health sport and fitness sectors.  9  Cited advantages include low power requirements operating for months or years on a button cell . small size and low cost. compatibility with a large installed base of mobile phones tablets and computers. History  edit  The nowdefunct Wibree logo In 2001 researchers at Nokia determined various scenarios that contemporary wireless technologies did not address.  10  The company began developing a wireless technology adapted from the Bluetooth standard which would provide lower power usage and cost while minimizing its differences from Bluetooth technology. The results were published in 2004 using the name Bluetooth Low End Extension.  11  After further development with partners in particular Logitech and within the European project MIMOSA  a  and actively promoted and supported by STMicroelectronics since its early stage  b  the technology was released to the public in October 2006 with the brand name Wibree.  14  After negotiations with Bluetooth SIG members an agreement was reached in June 2007 to include Wibree in a future Bluetooth specification as a Bluetooth ultra low power technology.  15   16  The technology was marketed as Bluetooth Smart and integration into version 4.0 of the Core Specification was completed in early 2010.  17  The first smartphone to implement the 4.0 specification was the iPhone 4S  released in October 2011.  18  A number of other manufacturers released Bluetooth Low Energy Ready devices in 2012. The Bluetooth SIG officially unveiled Bluetooth 5 on 16 June 2016 during a media event in London. One change on the marketing side is that the point number was dropped so it is now just called Bluetooth 5 and not Bluetooth 5.0 or 5.0 LE like for Bluetooth 4.0. This decision was made to simplify marketing and communicate user benefits more effectively.  19  On the technical side Bluetooth 5 will quadruple the range by using increased transmit power or coded physical layer double the speed by using optional half of the symbol time compared to Bluetooth 4.x and provide an eightfold increase in data broadcasting capacity by increasing the advertising data length  clarification needed  of low energy Bluetooth transmissions compared to Bluetooth 4.x which could be important for IoT applications where nodes are connected throughout a whole house.  20  An advertising packet in Bluetooth parlance is the information that is exchanged between two devices before pairing i.e. when they are not connected. For example advertising packets allow a device to display to the user the name of another Bluetooth device before pairing with it.  21  Bluetooth 5 will increase the data length of this advertising packet. The length of this packet in Bluetooth 4.x was 31 bytes for broadcast topology. The Bluetooth SIG released Mesh Profile and Mesh Model specifications officially on 18 July 2017. Mesh specification enables using Bluetooth Low Energy for manytomany device communications for home automation  sensor networks and other applications.  22  Applications  edit  Borrowing from the original Bluetooth specification the Bluetooth SIG defines several profiles  specifications for how a device works in a particular application  for low energy devices. Manufacturers are expected to implement the appropriate specifications for their device in order to ensure compatibility. A device may contain implementations of multiple profiles. The majority of current low energy application profiles are based on the Generic Attribute Profile GATT a general specification for sending and receiving short pieces of data known as attributes over a low energy link.  23  The Bluetooth mesh profile is an exception to this rule being based on the General Access Profile GAP.  24  Mesh profiles  edit  Bluetooth mesh profiles use Bluetooth Low Energy to communicate with other Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the network. Each device can pass the information forward to other Bluetooth Low Energy devices creating a mesh effect. For example switching off an entire building of lights from a single smartphone.  25  MESH  Mesh Profile   for base mesh networking. MMDL  Mesh models   for application layer definitions. Term model is used in mesh specifications instead of profile to avoid ambiguities. Health care profiles  edit  There are many profiles for Bluetooth Low Energy devices in healthcare applications. The Continua Health Alliance consortium promotes these in cooperation with the Bluetooth SIG. BLP Blood Pressure Profile  for blood pressure measurement. HTP Health Thermometer Profile  for medical temperature measurement devices. GLP Glucose Profile  for blood glucose monitors. CGMP Continuous Glucose Monitor Profile Sports and fitness profiles  edit  Profiles for sporting and fitness accessories include BCS Body Composition Service CSCP Cycling Speed and Cadence Profile  for sensors attached to a bicycle or exercise bike to measure cadence and wheel speed. CPP Cycling Power Profile HRP Heart Rate Profile  for devices which measure heart rate LNP Location and Navigation Profile RSCP Running Speed and Cadence Profile WSP Weight Scale Profile Internet connection  edit  Generic sensors  edit  ESP Environmental Sensing Profile UDS User Data Service HID connectivity  edit  HOGP  HID over GATT Profile allowing Bluetooth LEenabled Wireless mice keyboards and other devices offering longlasting battery life. Proximity sensing  edit  Main article Bluetooth Low Energy beacon Electronic leash applications are well suited to the long battery life possible for alwayson devices.  26  Manufacturers of iBeacon devices implement the appropriate specifications for their device to make use of proximity sensing capabilities supported by Apple s iOS devices .  27  Relevant application profiles include FMP  the find me profile  allows one device to issue an alert on a second misplaced device.  28  PXP  the proximity profile  allows a proximity monitor to detect whether a proximity reporter is within a close range. Physical proximity can be estimated using the radio receivers RSSI value although this does not have absolute calibration of distances. Typically an alarm may be sounded when the distance between the devices exceeds a set threshold. Alerts and time profiles  edit  The phone alert status profile and alert notification profile allow a client device to receive notifications such as incoming call alerts from another device. The time profile allows current time and time zone information on a client device to be set from a server device such as between a wristwatch and a mobile phones network time . Battery  edit  The Battery Service exposes the Battery State and Battery Level of a single battery or set of batteries in a device. Audio  edit  Announced in January 2020 LE Audio allows the protocol to carry sound and add features such as one set of headphones connecting to multiple audio sources or multiple headphones connecting to one source  29   30  and also adds support for hearing aids.  31  It introduces LC3 as its default codec.  32  Compared with standard Bluetooth audio it offers longer battery life.  32  Specifications on the implementation of Basic Audio Profile and Coordinated Set Identification was released in 2021  33   34   35  and the Common Audio Profile and Service in March 2022.  36   37  Contact tracing and notification  edit  Main articles Digital contact tracing  Bluetooth proximity tracing  Contact tracing  Mobile phones  and Exposure Notification In December 2020 the Bluetooth SIG released a draft specification for a wearable exposure notification service. This service allows exposure notification services on wearable devices to communicate with and be controlled by client devices such as smartphones.  38  Implementation  edit  Chip  edit  Starting in late 2009 Bluetooth Low Energy integrated circuits were announced by a number of manufacturers. These ICs commonly use software radio so updates to the specification can be accommodated through a firmware upgrade. Hardware  edit  Current mobile devices are commonly released with hardware and software support for both classic Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy. Operating systems  edit  iOS 5 and later  39  Windows Phone 8.1  40  Windows 8 and later  41  Windows 7 and earlier requires drivers from Bluetooth radio manufacturer supporting BLE stack as it has no builtin generic BLE drivers.  42   Android 4.3 and later.  43  Android 6 or later requires location permission to connect to BLE. BlackBerry OS 10  44  Linux 3.4 and later through BlueZ 5.0  45  Unison OS 5.2  46  macOS 10.10 Zephyr OS Technical details  edit  Radio interface  edit  Bluetooth Low Energy technology operates in the same spectrum range the 2.4002.4835 GHz ISM band  as classic Bluetooth technology but uses a different set of channels. Instead of the classic Bluetooth 79 1MHz channels Bluetooth Low Energy has 40 2MHz channels. Within a channel data is transmitted using Gaussian frequency shift modulation  similar to classic Bluetooths Basic Rate scheme. The bit rate is 1 Mbits with an option of 2 Mbits in Bluetooth 5 and the maximum transmit power is 10 mW 100 mW in Bluetooth 5. Further details are given in Volume 6 Part A Physical Layer Specification of the Bluetooth Core Specification V4.0 . Bluetooth Low Energy uses frequency hopping to counteract narrowband interference problems. Classic Bluetooth also uses frequency hopping but the details are different as a result while both FCC and ETSI classify Bluetooth technology as an FHSS scheme Bluetooth Low Energy is classified as a system using digital modulation techniques or a directsequence spread spectrum .  47  Specification BasicEnhanced Data Rate Low Energy Nominal max. range 100 m 330 ft 100 m 330 ft Over the air data rate  clarify  13 Mbits 125 kbits 500 kbits 1 Mbits 2 Mbits Application throughput  or  goodput  0.72.1 Mbits 0.271.37 Mbits  48  Active slaves 7 Not defined implementation dependent Security 56128bit and application layer user defined 128bit AES in CCM mode and application layer user defined Robustness Adaptive fast frequency hopping FEC  fast ACK Adaptive frequency hopping lazy acknowledgement 24bit CRC 32bit message integrity check Wake latency from a nonconnected state Typically 100 ms 6 ms Minimum total time to send data det. battery life 0.625 ms 3 ms  49  Voice capable Yes Yes  50  Network topology Scatternet Scatternet Power consumption 1 W as the reference 0.010.50 W depending on use case Peak current consumption 30 mA 15 mA Primary use cases Mobile phones gaming headsets stereo audio streaming smart homes wearables automotive PCs security proximity healthcare sports  fitness etc. Mobile phones gaming smart homes wearables automotive PCs security proximity healthcare sports  fitness Industrial etc. More technical details may be obtained from official specification as published by the Bluetooth SIG. Note that power consumption is not part of the Bluetooth specification. Advertising and discovery  edit  BLE devices are detected through a procedure based on broadcasting advertising packets. This is done using 3 separate channels frequencies in order to reduce interference. The advertising device sends a packet on at least one of these three channels with a repetition period called the advertising interval. For reducing the chance of multiple consecutive collisions a random delay of up to 10 milliseconds is added to each advertising interval. The scanner listens to the channel for a duration called the scan window which is periodically repeated every scan interval. The discovery latency is therefore determined by a probabilistic process and depends on the three parameters viz. the advertising interval the scan interval and the scan window. The discovery scheme of BLE adopts a periodicinterval based technique for which upper bounds on the discovery latency can be inferred for most parametrizations. While the discovery latencies of BLE can be approximated by models  51  for purely periodic intervalbased protocols the random delay added to each advertising interval and the threechannel discovery can cause deviations from these predictions or potentially lead to unbounded latencies for certain parametrizations.  52  Security  edit  Bluetooth Low Energy has security instances such as the Encrypted Advertising Data EAD feature allowing some or all of the application data payload that is transmitted in advertising packets to be encrypted. A standard mechanism for the sharing of key material between a broadcasting device and the observers that are intended to receive this data is also defined so that the data may be decrypted when received.  53  All transmitted Bluetooth LE PDUs include a Cyclic Redundancy Check CRC that is recalculated and checked by the receiving device for the possibility of the PDU having been changed in flight.  53  Software model  edit  All Bluetooth Low Energy devices use the Generic Attribute Profile GATT. The application programming interface offered by a Bluetooth Low Energy aware operating system will typically be based around GATT concepts.  54  GATT has the following terminology Client A device that initiates GATT commands and requests and accepts responses for example a computer or smartphone. Server A device that receives GATT commands and requests and returns responses for example a temperature sensor. Characteristic A data value transferred between client and server for example the current battery voltage. Service A collection of related characteristics which operate together to perform a particular function. For instance the Health Thermometer service includes characteristics for a temperature measurement value and a time interval between measurements. Descriptor A descriptor provides additional information about a characteristic. For instance a temperature value characteristic may have an indication of its units e.g. Celsius and the maximum and minimum values which the sensor can measure. Descriptors are optional  each characteristic can have any number of descriptors. Some service and characteristic values are used for administrative purposes  for instance the model name and serial number can be read as standard characteristics within the Generic Access service. Services may also include other services as subfunctions the main functions of the device are socalled primary services and the auxiliary functions they refer to are secondary services. Identifiers  edit  Services characteristics and descriptors are collectively referred to as attributes  and identified by UUIDs . Any implementer may pick a random or pseudorandom UUID for proprietary uses but the Bluetooth SIG have reserved a range of UUIDs of the form xxxxxxxx00001000800000805F9B34FB  55   for standard attributes. For efficiency these identifiers are represented as 16bit or 32bit values in the protocol rather than the 128 bits required for a full UUID. For example the Device Information service has the short code 0x180A rather than 0000180A00001000... . The full list is kept in the Bluetooth Assigned Numbers document online. GATT operations  edit  The GATT protocol provides a number of commands for the client to discover information about the server. These include Discover UUIDs for all primary services Find a service with a given UUID Find secondary services for a given primary service Discover all characteristics for a given service Find characteristics matching a given UUID Read all descriptors for a particular characteristic Commands are also provided to read data transfer from server to client and write from client to server the values of characteristics A value may be read either by specifying the characteristics UUID or by a handle value which is returned by the information discovery commands above. Write operations always identify the characteristic by handle but have a choice of whether or not a response from the server is required. Long read and Long write operations can be used when the length of the characteristics data exceeds the MTU of the radio link. Finally GATT offers notifications and indications . The client may request a notification for a particular characteristic from the server. The server can then send the value to the client whenever it becomes available. For instance a temperature sensor server may notify its client every time it takes a measurement. This avoids the need for the client to poll the server which would require the servers radio circuitry to be constantly operational. An indication is similar to a notification except that it requires a response from the client as confirmation that it has received the message. Battery impact  edit  Bluetooth Low Energy chipset power consumption when acting as a beacon  as per The Hitchhikers Guide to iBeacon Hardware by Aislelabs.  56  Bluetooth Low Energy is designed to enable devices to have very low power consumption. Several chipmakers including Cambridge Silicon Radio  Dialog Semiconductor  Nordic Semiconductor  STMicroelectronics  Cypress Semiconductor  Silicon Labs and Texas Instruments had introduced Bluetooth Low Energy optimized chipsets by 2014. Devices with peripheral and central roles have different power requirements. A study by beacon software company Aislelabs reported that peripherals such as proximity beacons usually function for 12 years powered by a 1000mAh coin cell battery.  57  This is possible because of the power efficiency of Bluetooth Low Energy protocol which only transmits small packets as compared to Bluetooth Classic which is also suitable for audio and high bandwidth data. In contrast a continuous scan for the same beacons in central role can consume 1000 mAh in a few hours. Android and iOS devices also have very different battery impact depending on type of scans and the number of Bluetooth Low Energy devices in the vicinity.  58  With newer chipsets and advances in software by 2014 both Android and iOS phones had negligible power consumption in reallife Bluetooth Low Energy use.  59  2M PHY  edit  Bluetooth 5 has introduced a new transmission mode with a doubled symbol rate . Bluetooth LE has been traditionally transmitting 1 bit per symbol so that theoretically the data rate doubles as well. However the new mode doubles the bandwidth from about 1 MHz to about 2 MHz which makes for more interferences on the edge regions. The partitioning of the ISM frequency band has not changed being still 40 channels spaced at a distance of 2 MHz.  60  This is an essential difference over Bluetooth 2 EDR which also doubled the data rate but was doing that by employing a π4DQPSK or 8DPSK phase modulation on a 1 MHz channel while Bluetooth 5 continues to use just frequency shift keying. The traditional transmission of 1 Mbit in the Bluetooth Basic Rate was renamed 1M PHY in Bluetooth 5. The new mode at a doubled symbol speed was introduced as the 2M PHY. In Bluetooth Low Energy every transmission starts on the 1M PHY leaving it to the application to initiate a switch to the 2M PHY. In that case both sender and receiver will switch to the 2M PHY for transmissions. This is designed to facilitate firmware updates where the application can switch back to a traditional 1M PHY in case of errors. In reality the target device should be close to the programming station at a few meters. LE Coded  edit  Bluetooth 5 has introduced two new modes with lower data rate. The symbol rate of the new Coded PHY is the same as the Base Rate 1M PHY but in mode S2 there are two symbols transmitted per data bit. In mode S2 only a simple Pattern Mapping P1 is used which simply produces the same stuffing bit for each input data bit. In mode S8 there are eight symbols per data bit with a Pattern Mapping P4 producing contrasting symbol sequences  a 0 bit is encoded as binary 0011 and a 1 bit is encoded as binary 1100.  61  In mode S2 using P1 the range doubles approximately while in mode S8 using P4 it does quadruple.  62  The LE Coded transmissions have not only changed the error correction scheme but it uses a fundamentally new packet format. Each LE Coded burst consists of three blocks. The switch block extended preamble is transmitted on the LE 1M PHY but it only consists of 10 times a binary 00111100 pattern. These 80 bits are not FEC encoded as usual but they are sent directly to the radio channel. It is followed by a header block FEC Block 1 which is always transmitted in S8 mode. The header block only contains the destination address Access Address  32 bit and an encoding flag Coding Indicator  2 Bit. The Coding Indicator defines the Pattern Mapping used for the following payload block FEC Block 2 where S2 is possible.  63  The new packet format of Bluetooth 5 allows transmitting from 2 up to 256 bytes as the payload in a single burst. This is a lot more than the maximum of 31 bytes in Bluetooth 4. Along with reach measurements this should allow for localisation functions. As a whole the quadrupled rangeat the same transmission poweris achieved at the expense of a lower data being at an eighth with 125 kbit. The old transmission packet format as it continues to be used in the 1M PHY and 2M PHY modes has been named Uncoded in Bluetooth 5. The intermediate LE Coded S2 mode allows for a 500 kbit data rate in the payload which is both beneficial for shorter latencies as well lower power consumption as the burst time itself is shorter.
